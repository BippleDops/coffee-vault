## Current Status

**Total Documents**: 14 existing + 35 to create = 49 total  
**Progress**: 14/49 = ~29% complete  

## Generation Strategy

I will systematically create all remaining documents following this order:
1. Complete Agronomy (5 documents)
2. Complete Coffee Chemistry (7 documents)
3. Complete Processing (9 documents)
4. Complete Sensory Science (7 documents)
5. Complete Roasting Science (10 documents)

Total: 38 new scientific reference documents

Each document will be comprehensive, include:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Structured sections with headers
- Practical applications
- Cross-references to related topics
- Educational value
- Tags for discoverability

## Execution Plan

Creating documents in batches for efficiency:
- 5-10 documents per execution round
- Track progress in this file
- Update status as completed
