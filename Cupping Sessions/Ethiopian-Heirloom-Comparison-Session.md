### Processing Impact Analysis

**Natural Process Expression**:

All samples were natural-processed, but execution quality varied dramatically:

**Modern Raised-Bed Natural (Chelelektu, Hambela, Limu, Bombe)**:
- Clean fermentation character
- Fruit development without funk
- No phenolic or acetic notes
- Transparency to terroir maintained
- Sweetness amplified
- Complexity preserved

**Traditional Ground-Dried Natural (Harrar)**:
- Wild fermentation character
- Earthy, funky notes prominent
- Over-fermentation risk evident
- Terroir masked by processing
- Polarizing profile
- Historical character vs modern quality

**Key Learning**: Processing methodology (raised bed vs ground drying, turning frequency, drying time, cherry sorting) has equal or greater impact than terroir on final cup quality. Modern Ethiopian naturals can achieve clean-cup standards competitive with washed coffees while maintaining fruit intensity.

### Terroir Expression Findings

**Conclusion**: Terroir persists most clearly in premium-processed samples. Traditional processing can mask or distort regional character.

### Altitude vs Complexity Correlation

**Hypothesis**: Higher altitude correlates with greater complexity and acidity.

**Data**:
- Kochere (2,100-2,300m): Complexity 9.5/10, Acidity 9.0/10
- Bombe (2,000-2,200m): Complexity 7.5/10, Acidity 8.25/10
- Guji (1,950-2,100m): Complexity 9.25/10, Acidity 8.5/10
- Limu (1,850-2,050m): Complexity 8.5/10, Acidity 8.0/10
- Harrar (1,800-2,100m): Complexity 6.5/10, Acidity 7.0/10

**Analysis**:
- Correlation exists but not absolute (Guji breaks pattern with high complexity at moderate altitude)
- Acidity shows stronger altitude correlation than complexity
- Processing quality confounds altitude effects (Harrar's low complexity may be processing-related)
- Other factors (soil, variety, microclimate) interact with altitude

**Refined Conclusion**: Altitude matters but optimal terroir is multifactorial. High altitude + volcanic soil + premium processing = highest scores.

### Heirloom Variety Expression

**Challenge**: Ethiopian heirlooms are genetically diverse and unclassified.

**Observations**:
- Each region shows distinct profile despite "heirloom" label
- Likely genetic differences between regional landraces
- Harrar genetics appear distinct (smaller beans, different profile)
- Genetic diversity within regions creates complexity
- Unclassified varieties prevent direct comparison to named cultivars

**Questions Raised**:
- Are Yirgacheffe heirlooms genetically distinct from Guji heirlooms?
- Does genetic diversity within lots contribute to complexity?
- Would single-variety Ethiopian lots taste more one-dimensional?
- Is "heirloom diversity" a feature rather than classification challenge?

**Industry Need**: Better genetic classification of Ethiopian landraces would help understand terroir vs variety impact.

### Commercial Viability Assessment

**Premium Tier** (90+ points, $8-12/lb green):
- Hambela Guji: YES - Fruit intensity, cleanliness, brand recognition
