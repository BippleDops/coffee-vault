## 🔍 Session Outcomes

### Key Discoveries

The Yirgacheffe Kochere stood out significantly for its clarity and complexity. The washed process showcased the origin's terroir beautifully - distinct bergamot and jasmine notes with tea-like body.

The Guji natural was fascinating - explosive fruit flavors (blueberry, strawberry) with wine-like characteristics. Very different from the washed coffees but equally complex.

Sidamo was solid but less distinctive - clean, balanced, but lacked the wow factor of the other two.

### Standout Samples

- **Yirgacheffe Kochere**: Exceptional clarity, floral complexity, perfect balance
- **Guji Natural**: Fruit bomb, unique fermentation notes, very clean for natural

### Surprises

The Guji natural was surprisingly clean - no fermentation defects or off-flavors. The natural process was executed perfectly, showcasing fruit without funkiness.

### Disappointments

Sidamo was good but not great - expected more complexity based on origin reputation. May be roast-related rather than bean quality.

### Comparative Analysis

- **Best Value**: Sidamo (good quality at moderate price)
- **Most Complex**: Yirgacheffe Kochere (incredible complexity)
- **Best Balance**: Yirgacheffe Kochere
- **Most Unique**: Guji Natural (distinctive natural process)

### Recommendations

**Would Purchase**:
- Yirgacheffe Kochere - Absolutely, already a favorite
- Guji Natural - Yes, for variety and when wanting fruit-forward

**Would Not Purchase**:
- None - all were specialty grade

**Blending Potential**: Yirgacheffe + Sidamo could create nice balanced blend

**Roasting Recommendations**: All are roasted appropriately for their characteristics

## 📝 Session Notes

**General Observations**:

This was my first formal SCA protocol cupping at home. The systematic approach revealed nuances I don't catch in regular brewing. Breaking coffee into aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance components really helps identify specific characteristics.

The cupping protocol emphasized cleanliness and clarity - all three coffees were remarkably clean with no defects. The Ethiopian coffee standards are clearly high.

Comparing washed vs natural processing side-by-side was enlightening. The processing method has enormous impact on flavor profile while origin characteristics still shine through.

**Protocol Deviations**: None - followed SCA protocol precisely

**Environmental Factors**: Optimal cupping conditions - good lighting, no distractions, fresh palate

**Learning Points**:
- SCA scoring helps identify specific strengths/weaknesses
- Comparing multiple coffees reveals relative characteristics
- Formal cupping shows details that brewing might miss
- The "break" moment is crucial for aroma evaluation
- Slurping technique takes practice but works

**Next Steps**:
- Practice more formal cuppings
- Try blind cupping next time
- Invite friends for group cupping
- Cup same coffee at different roast levels
- Practice scoring consistency
