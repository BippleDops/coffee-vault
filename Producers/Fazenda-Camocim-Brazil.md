# Fazenda Camocim

## Overview

Fazenda Camocim stands as a pioneering model for organic, socially responsible, and environmentally regenerative coffee production in Brazil's Cerrado Mineiro region—a 1,200-hectare estate (600 hectares in coffee production, 600 hectares preserved native Cerrado) producing 500-800 tons annually of exceptional coffees scoring 85-93 points. Co-owned and managed by Silvia Barretto and her family since 1974, Camocim achieved organic certification in 2005 (among Brazil's first commercial-scale organic coffee estates), Rainforest Alliance certification in 2008, and B Corporation certification in 2018, demonstrating that large-scale coffee farming can deliver both outstanding quality and exceptional environmental and social performance.

Located in the municipality of Patrocínio, Minas Gerais, at 900-1,250 MASL, Fazenda Camocim cultivates Yellow Bourbon, Catuai, Mundo Novo, and Catucai across diverse microclimates and elevations, processing coffees using natural, pulped natural, washed, and experimental anaerobic methods. The estate's commitment to preserving 50% of its land as native Cerrado savanna—one of the world's most biodiverse yet threatened ecosystems—combined with organic farming, renewable energy, water conservation, and progressive employee programs (profit-sharing, housing, education, healthcare), positions Camocim as a leader in sustainable coffee and a model for the future of Brazilian specialty production.

Beyond environmental excellence, Camocim's social impact is profound: the estate employs 80+ permanent workers and 200+ seasonal harvesters, providing above-market wages, profit-sharing, quality housing, healthcare, and education support. Silvia Barretto's leadership—as one of Brazil's few women coffee estate owners and a vocal advocate for women in coffee, environmental conservation, and social responsibility—has earned Camocim international recognition, including features in specialty coffee media, sustainability awards, and partnerships with leading roasters committed to ethical sourcing.

## Location and Geography

### Cerrado Mineiro Context

**Cerrado Mineiro**: Brazil's first coffee region to receive Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status (2005), located in northwestern Minas Gerais state, high-altitude plateau (800-1,300 MASL)

**Geographic Extent**: 55 municipalities across ~5 million hectares, producing ~6 million bags annually (10% of Brazil's total)

**Patrocínio**: Municipality in Cerrado Mineiro where Fazenda Camocim located, coffee-growing heartland

**Altitude Range**: 900-1,250 meters above sea level (Fazenda Camocim)
- Higher elevations (1,100-1,250m) produce most complex, highest-scoring coffees (Yellow Bourbon micro-lots)
- Lower elevations (900-1,000m) higher yields, mechanized harvest (Catuai, Mundo Novo)

**Microclimate**: Tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw), distinct wet and dry seasons
- **May-September**: Dry season and harvest (virtually no rain, ideal for natural processing)
- **October-April**: Wet season (1,400-1,800mm annual rainfall concentrated in these months)
- Temperature: 18-28°C (moderate year-round, cool nights at higher elevations)
- Sunshine: ~2,500 hours annually (high solar radiation, intense photosynthesis)
- Frost risk: Minimal (Cerrado's altitude and latitude protect from southern Brazil's frost belt)

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Red latosol (oxisol), deep (3-5 meters), well-draining, naturally acidic (pH 5.0-5.5), low natural fertility (requires amendments even for organic farming)

**Topography**: Gently rolling plateau (slopes 0-15 degrees), highly mechanizable (much of Camocim's lower-elevation areas mechanically harvested)

**Water**: Seasonal streams and aquifers (water scarce during dry season, irrigation critical for consistent production), estate maintains spring-fed reservoirs

**Native Cerrado**: Brazilian savanna ecosystem, 600 hectares preserved on estate
- 11,000+ plant species (5,000+ endemic), third-most biodiverse ecosystem in world (after Amazon and Atlantic Forest)
- Critically threatened: 50% of original Cerrado converted to agriculture (soy, cattle, coffee)
- Camocim's conservation: Protects headwaters, wildlife corridors, endemic species

## Historical Context and Family Story

### Cerrado Coffee Boom (1970s-1980s)

**Government Development Program**: Brazilian government promoted Cerrado agricultural development (1970s)
- Subsidized land clearing, mechanization, irrigation

- Full body, chocolate, nuts, low acidity, 84-87 points

**Catucai** (10% of production, 1,000-1,200 MASL):
- Hybrid (Catuai x Icatu), disease-resistant, productive
- Balanced cup, chocolate, caramel, 85-88 points

### Organic Farming Practices (Certified 2005)

**Soil Health Management**:
- Compost from coffee pulp and processing waste (thousands of tons annually, returned to fields)
- Cover crops (legumes, grasses) between coffee rows (nitrogen fixation, erosion control, organic matter)
- Organic fertilizers (composted manure, plant-based amendments)
- No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers (organic certification requirement)

**Pest and Disease Management**:
- Biological control: Birds, beneficial insects, natural predators (Cerrado preservation provides habitat)
- Monitoring and early intervention (manual removal of coffee berry borer)
- Disease-resistant varieties (Catucai, Icatu genetics)
- Reduced disease pressure: Cerrado's dry season limits fungal diseases (coffee leaf rust less problematic than humid regions)

**Challenges**:
- Organic management more labor-intensive (manual weeding, pest monitoring)
- Yields 5-10% lower than conventional (offset by organic premiums)
- Soil fertility: Cerrado soils naturally low-fertility, requires continuous organic inputs

### Agroecology and Cerrado Conservation

**Native Cerrado Preservation** (600 hectares):
- Original savanna ecosystem, never cleared, legally protected by estate
- Biodiversity: 500+ plant species, 200+ bird species, mammals (maned wolf, giant anteater, armadillo, deer)
- Ecosystem services: Watershed protection (springs and streams originate in Cerrado), pollinator habitat (native bees critical for coffee flowering), pest control (birds and bats consume coffee berry borer)

**Buffer Zones**: Coffee cultivation transitions gradually to Cerrado (mixed native trees and coffee in buffer areas, 50 hectares)

**Selective Shade**: Lower-elevation areas minimal shade (mechanized harvest), higher-elevation areas moderate shade (20-30% coverage, native Cerrado trees, legumes)

**Water Conservation**: Rainwater harvesting, reservoir management, irrigation efficiency (drip irrigation in some blocks)

### Harvest Management

**Harvest Season**: May-September (dry season, peak June-July)

**Mechanized Harvest** (60% of production, lower-elevation Catuai and Mundo Novo):
- Tractor-mounted harvesters strip all cherries simultaneously
- Post-harvest sorting critical (separate ripe, underripe, overripe, defects)
- Cost-effective for high-volume production

**Manual Harvest** (40% of production, higher-elevation Yellow Bourbon, Catucai micro-lots):
- Selective picking, only fully ripe cherries
- Multiple passes (3-4) over season
- Higher cost but superior quality (micro-lot differentiation)

## Processing Methods: Diversity and Innovation
