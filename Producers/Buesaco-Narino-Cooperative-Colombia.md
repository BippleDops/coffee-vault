## ☕ Varieties Cultivated (By Members)

**Primary Varieties**:

1. **Caturra** (50% of collective)
   - Traditional Colombian variety
   - Excellent cup quality
   - Adapted to high altitude
   - Lower yield accepted for quality
   - Cooperative's flagship variety

2. **Castillo** (30%)
   - Colombian rust-resistant variety
   - Higher yield, disease resistance
   - Good cup quality
   - Introduced post-2000s rust epidemic
   - Provides production stability

3. **Colombia** (15%)
   - Another rust-resistant variety
   - Reliable production
   - Consistent quality
   - Farm resilience

4. **Typica** (5%)
   - Heritage variety

## 🔬 Processing Methods

**Primary Processing**: Washed (Colombian Traditional)

**Cooperative Processing Model**:
Members can either:
1. Process at home (traditional farm-level wet mill)
2. Deliver cherry to cooperative processing center

**Home Processing** (Most Common):
1. **Harvest**: Selective hand-picking, ripe cherry only
2. **Depulping**: Small eco-pulper at farm
3. **Fermentation**: 12-24 hours (cooler highland temps)
4. **Washing**: Clean water, multiple rinses
5. **Drying**: Parabolic dryers or covered patios (rain protection)
6. **Delivery**: Parchment to cooperative

**Cooperative Processing Center** (Optional):
- Members can deliver cherry
- Centralized processing
- Quality control oversight
- Training and support

**Double Fermentation** (Premium Lots):
Some members experiment with extended fermentation:
- First fermentation: 18-24 hours
- Partial wash
- Second fermentation: 12-18 hours
- Final washing
- Creates enhanced sweetness and complexity

**Quality Control** (Cooperative Level):
1. **Reception**: Parchment received from members
2. **Cupping**: Sample roasting and evaluation
3. **Grading**: Quality-based classification
4. **Sorting**: Defect removal, screen sizing
5. **Lot Separation**: Quality tiers, premium lots

**Moisture Management**:
- Target: 10-11% moisture
- Cooperative provides moisture meters
- Training on optimal drying
- Quality incentive programs
