# Mzuzu Coffee Cooperative

## Overview

Mzuzu Coffee Cooperative (Mzuzu COOP) represents the transformation of Malawi's coffee sector from colonial estate production to empowered smallholder agriculture. Established in 2003 in northern Malawi's mountainous highlands, the cooperative unites 4,200 smallholder families producing specialty coffees that score 82-87 points and offer exceptional value in the competitive African coffee market.

Malawi, often overshadowed by its more famous East African neighbors (Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania), produces approximately 20,000-25,000 tons of coffee annually, with the Northern Region accounting for 60% of national production. Mzuzu COOP has emerged as the country's premier quality-focused cooperative, pioneering specialty coffee production and direct trade relationships that bypass traditional colonial-era trading structures.

Beyond coffee quality, Mzuzu COOP exemplifies community resilience in the face of significant challenges: HIV/AIDS prevalence, climate variability, historic underinvestment, and competition from higher-value crops like macadamia nuts. The cooperative's commitment to women's empowerment (52% women members), healthcare support, and sustainable agriculture has created economic opportunity and improved livelihoods for over 16,000 people across 38 villages.
