## 📝 Producer Story

Finca La Esperanza ("The Hope Farm") was established in 1985 by Carlos Imbachi's grandfather in Pitalito, Huila. The first generation grew commercial coffee through Colombian Federation (FNC) system, earning commodity prices.

**Transition to Specialty** (2000s):
Carlos's father recognized specialty coffee opportunity in early 2000s. He began:
- Selective picking (only ripe cherry)
- Improved processing (better fermentation control)
- Direct relationships with specialty buyers
- Quality focus over volume

**Third Generation Innovation** (2010s-Present):
Carlos (current generation) studied agronomy and specialty coffee:
- Introduced Pink Bourbon variety (2015)
- Experimented with honey and anaerobic processing
- Developed direct roaster relationships
- Achieved organic certification
- Focused on environmental sustainability

**Pink Bourbon Journey**:
Hearing about Pink Bourbon's exceptional cup quality, Carlos planted 2 hectares in 2015. The variety is challenging:
- Lower yield than commercial varieties
- Susceptible to diseases
- Requires careful cultivation

But rewards are significant:
- Cupping scores 86-90 points
- Premium pricing ($10-15/lb green)
- Strong roaster interest
- Farm's reputation enhanced

**Current Operations**:
La Esperanza balances:
- Reliable income (Caturra, Castillo standard lots)
- Premium micro-lots (Pink Bourbon)
- Processing experimentation (honey, anaerobic)
- Sustainability (organic, environmental stewardship)
- Family involvement (multi-generational)

The farm demonstrates how Colombian smallholders can thrive in specialty coffee through quality focus, innovation, and direct relationships.
