# Finca Maputo

## Overview

Finca Maputo represents the renaissance of Ecuadorian specialty coffee, transforming from century-old traditional farm to cutting-edge quality and processing innovation leader. Located in the southern highlands of Loja province at 1,600-2,100 MASL, this fourth-generation family estate has become synonymous with Ecuador's emergence as a specialty origin, producing exceptional coffees scoring 85-91 points that showcase unique Ecuadorian terroir alongside groundbreaking processing experimentation.

Ecuador, despite being the namesake of the Equator and possessing ideal coffee-growing conditions, has historically been overshadowed by its South American neighbors Colombia and Peru in the specialty market. Finca Maputo has been instrumental in changing this narrative. The Serrano family's commitment to heirloom variety preservation (Typica, Bourbon), experimental variety trials (Sidra, Geisha), and processing innovation (anaerobic, extended fermentation, carbonic maceration) has earned international recognition and demonstrated Ecuador's potential to produce world-class specialty coffee.

Beyond exceptional quality, Finca Maputo exemplifies sustainable family coffee production: organic certified since 2008, 60% shade canopy protecting biodiverse cloud forest ecosystems, community employment providing livelihoods for 25+ families, and knowledge sharing with neighboring producers elevating the entire Loja region. The farm's name "Maputo" reflects the family's vision of coffee as bridge between cultures and continents, connecting Ecuador's unique terroir to coffee lovers worldwide.

## Location and Geography

### Regional Context

**Loja Province**: Southern highlands of Ecuador, bordering Peru, renowned for high-quality Arabica production and unique microclimate.

**Vilcabamba Valley Region**: "Valley of Longevity," famous for healthy climate, pristine environment, and exceptional coffee terroir.

**Altitude**: 1,600-2,100 meters above sea level
- Wide elevation range creates diverse microclimates within single farm
- Higher elevations (1,900-2,100m) produce most complex coffees
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (12-18°C swings)
- Slower cherry maturation at altitude (7-9 months from flower to harvest)

**Microclimate**: Equatorial mountain climate with consistent rainfall
- June-September: Primary harvest season (drier period)
- October-March: Wet season (flowering and cherry development)
- April-May: Transition (some late harvest)
- Annual rainfall: 1,800-2,400mm (high, consistent)
- Equatorial location means consistent temperature year-round (no winter/summer extremes)
- Morning mist and afternoon clouds common
- Temperature: 16-24°C year-round (elevation-dependent)

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil Composition**:
- Volcanic ash soils from ancient volcanic activity
- Deep, well-draining loam (1-2 meters depth)
- Rich in minerals: phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium
- High organic matter from cloud forest integration (10-14%)
- pH slightly acidic (5.5-6.5), ideal for coffee
- Excellent water retention despite drainage

**Topography**:
- Steep mountain slopes (30-50 degrees)
- Terracing essential for cultivation and erosion control
- Elevation gradient within farm creates harvest timing variation
- Protected valleys with optimal sun exposure

**Water Sources**:

- No synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers
- Compost from coffee pulp and farm waste (100% recycling)
- Vermicomposting (worm compost, high nutrient value)
- Natural pest management (beneficial insects, shade biodiversity)
- Disease management through cultural practices (pruning, spacing, variety resistance)

**Intensive Agroforestry** (60% shade coverage):

- Vermicompost: 2-3kg per tree for young trees and stressed trees
- Coffee pulp mulch: Heavy application (100% recycled from processing)
- Foliar fertilization with compost tea during critical growth periods
- Nitrogen from shade tree leaf drop and nitrogen-fixing trees

**Integrated Pest Management**:
- Coffee leaf rust monitoring (monthly inspections)
- Organic copper-based fungicides (limited preventative use during wet season)
- Coffee berry borer management: Traps, cultural practices, biological control
- Beneficial insects: Birds, parasitic wasps, predatory insects (habitat provided by shade)
- Minimal intervention philosophy (healthy ecosystem reduces pest pressure)

### Harvest Management

**Harvest Season**: June-September (peak July-August)
- Ecuador's drier season
- Extended harvest due to elevation gradient and variety timing
- Equatorial location means flowering triggered by rain after dry periods

**Selective Harvesting**:

- Protects downstream communities and ecosystems

**Watershed Protection**:
- Cloud forest protects headwaters
- Erosion control prevents siltation
- Springs and streams maintain flow year-round

### Carbon Footprint
