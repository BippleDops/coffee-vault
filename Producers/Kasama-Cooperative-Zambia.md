# Kasama Coffee Cooperative - Zambia

## Overview

Kasama Coffee Cooperative represents Zambia's pioneering specialty coffee cooperative, bringing together approximately 750 smallholder farming families across the Northern Province plateau—a remote, impoverished region where coffee cultivation offers one of the few pathways out of subsistence agriculture and extreme poverty. Established in 2004 during Zambia's coffee sector revival (after decades of post-independence decline), the cooperative has transformed livelihoods by providing direct Fair Trade market access, achieving organic certification, producing specialty-grade coffee scoring 84-89 points, and investing Fair Trade premiums in community development addressing critical needs in health, education, water, and infrastructure. Members cultivate Bourbon, Catimor, Kenya (SL28/SL34), and Mundo Novo varieties at 1,200-1,800 meters above sea level on the Muchinga Escarpment and Northern Plateau—regions characterized by volcanic soils, rolling hills, miombo woodland, abundant rainfall, and isolation from markets and services.

The cooperative operates across one of Africa's most remote and infrastructure-poor regions—dirt roads impassable during rains, no electricity in many communities, minimal healthcare and education services, and extreme poverty rates exceeding 80%. Yet Kasama Cooperative has demonstrated that even in these challenging conditions, smallholder organization can succeed: members now earn 2-4x local market rates through Fair Trade/organic premiums, the cooperative has built 8 washing stations distributed across member territories providing wet processing infrastructure, and community development programs have delivered clean water to 12,000+ people, built/renovated 15 schools, established health clinics, and funded hundreds of educational scholarships. Annual production reaches 220-320 tons of green coffee, almost entirely organic-certified, with growing volumes of washed, natural, and honey-processed specialty lots attracting European and North American specialty buyers.

Zambia is one of Africa's smallest coffee producers (entire country produces only 600-1,200 tons annually—less than many individual estates in Brazil or Colombia), making it virtually unknown in global specialty markets despite producing distinctive high-quality coffees with bright acidity, complex fruit flavors, and clean profiles reminiscent of East African greats (Kenya, Tanzania). Kasama Cooperative accounts for 30-40% of Zambian national production, making it not just a cooperative but effectively the guardian of Zambian specialty coffee. The cooperative faces extraordinary challenges—climate change impacts (irregular rains, droughts), infrastructure deficits, youth migration to cities and copper mines, competition from more profitable crops (tobacco, cannabis), and the constant struggle of extreme poverty—yet 20 years of operation demonstrate that quality focus, cooperative solidarity, and Fair Trade partnerships can enable smallholder communities to thrive even in Africa's most marginalized regions.

## Location and Geography

### Northern Province, Zambia

Northern Province is Zambia's most remote and poorest province, occupying the country's northeastern region bordering Tanzania (north) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (west). The province is characterized by vast distances, sparse population, limited infrastructure, and geographic isolation from Zambia's economic centers (Lusaka, the Copperbelt mining region).

**Kasama District**:
- **Provincial capital**: Kasama town (population ~100,000), administrative and commercial center
- **Cooperative territory**: Extends 50-100 km radius from Kasama town, encompassing dozens of rural villages
- **Distance from Lusaka**: 850 km north (12-15 hours on deteriorating roads, or 2-hour flight when available)
- **Access**: Great North Road (main artery) paved but poorly maintained; rural roads dirt tracks impassable during rainy season

**Topography**:
The cooperative operates across two primary geographic zones:

1. **Muchinga Escarpment** (western members):
   - Elevation: 1,400-1,800 MASL (highest coffee in Zambia)
   - Steep slopes descending from plateau toward Congo basin
   - Dramatic terrain, cloud cover, highest quality potential
   - Most remote communities (6-10 hours from Kasama on poor roads)

2. **Northern Plateau** (eastern/central members):
   - Elevation: 1,200-1,500 MASL
   - Rolling hills, gentle slopes
   - Miombo woodland landscape
   - Better road access (2-5 hours from Kasama)

**Climate**:
Northern Zambia has tropical savanna climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons:

- **Rainy season**: November-April (peak rains December-March), 1,000-1,500mm annually
- **Dry/cool season**: May-September (harvest season May-August), minimal rain, cool nights
- **Temperature**: 18-28°C (64-82°F) during growing season, cooler during dry season (10-20°C nights)
- **Cool season**: June-August, morning temperatures can drop to 8-12°C (46-54°F)
- **Humidity**: High during rainy season (80-95%), moderate during dry season (40-60%)
- **Climate variability**: Increasingly irregular rainfall, delayed onset of rains, mid-season droughts (climate change impacts)

**Soil**:
- **Type**: Weathered tropical soils, iron-rich red-brown clay-loam
- **Fertility**: Moderate natural fertility, depleted by decades of tobacco cultivation in some areas
- **Drainage**: Good on slopes (escarpment), variable on plateau (some waterlogged areas during rains)
- **pH**: Acidic (5.0-6.0), suitable for coffee
- **Organic matter**: Low to moderate (2-4%) in cultivated areas, higher (6-8%) in forested zones
- **Volcanic influence**: Some areas show volcanic soil characteristics (higher fertility, mineral content)

**Ecosystem**:
- **Miombo woodland**: Dominant ecosystem—dry deciduous woodland characterized by Brachystegia, Julbernardia, and Isoberlinia tree species
- **Biodiversity**: Moderate—elephants (in protected areas), various antelope species, leopards, diverse birdlife
- **Deforestation**: Pressure from charcoal production, tobacco curing (requires wood fuel), agricultural expansion
- **Conservation**: Some coffee farms adjacent to forest reserves, national parks

### Infrastructure and Isolation Challenges

**Roads**:
- Main road to Kasama paved but deteriorating (potholes, sections washed out)
- Rural roads dirt tracks—impassable during rainy season (November-April)
- Coffee transport extremely difficult, expensive during rains
- Isolation prevents market access for many farmers

**Utilities**:
- **Electricity**: Kasama town has unreliable grid power (frequent outages); rural communities no electricity
- **Water**: Most communities rely on wells, streams (often contaminated); limited clean water access
- **Telecommunications**: Limited cell phone coverage (main roads, Kasama town only); no internet in rural areas

**Services**:
- **Healthcare**: Few rural health clinics, poorly equipped; nearest hospital often 50-100 km away
- **Education**: Primary schools exist but often lack teachers, materials; secondary schools rare, requiring boarding far from home
- **Markets**: Limited access to input markets (seeds, tools, fertilizers) and output markets (selling crops)

This extreme isolation makes cooperative organization critical—individual farmers could never access international markets or certifications alone.

## Historical Context

### Zambia's Coffee History

**Colonial Introduction (1950s)**:
Coffee was introduced to Northern Rhodesia (colonial Zambia) in the 1950s by British colonial authorities and estate operators. Initial cultivation focused on large estates, particularly in Northern Province and parts of Eastern Province, growing Bourbon and Typica varieties. Production remained modest (5,000-8,000 tons in 1960s).

**Independence and Decline (1964-1990s)**:
- **1964**: Zambian independence from Britain
- **1970s-1980s**: Government focus on copper mining (Zambia's dominant industry), agriculture neglected
- **Coffee boards collapse**: Government coffee marketing boards inefficient, corrupt, collapsed
- **Estate abandonment**: Many estates abandoned as profitability declined, infrastructure decayed
- **Smallholder poverty**: Small farmers selling to exploitative intermediaries at minimal prices, or abandoning coffee for subsistence crops
- **Production collapse**: By late 1990s, Zambian coffee production fallen to 500-1,000 tons annually

**Revival and Kasama Cooperative Formation (2000s)**:
In early 2000s, international development organizations (USAID, British aid, Fair Trade networks) and progressive Zambian agricultural officials identified Northern Province coffee potential:

- **Quality potential**: High altitude, suitable soils, rainfall pattern ideal for specialty coffee
- **Poverty alleviation**: Coffee could provide cash income in extremely poor region with few alternatives
- **Market opportunity**: Fair Trade and organic markets seeking new origins, willing to pay premiums
- **2003-2004**: Feasibility studies, farmer consultations, cooperative organizing
- **2004**: Kasama Coffee Cooperative officially established with 180 founding members

**Founding Vision**:
- Eliminate predatory intermediaries (traders paying farmers 10-20% of export value)
- Pool resources for wet processing infrastructure (individual farmers couldn't afford)
- Achieve Fair Trade and organic certifications for premium market access
- Improve quality to compete in specialty markets (overcoming "Zambia unknown origin" barrier)
- Invest Fair Trade premiums in community development (water, health, education)

**Growth (2004-present)**:
- **2005**: First wet processing station built (with donor support), organic transition begins
- **2006**: Fair Trade certification achieved, first exports to UK Fair Trade buyers
- **2007**: Organic certification (EU, USDA), majority of members already farming organically by default (no money for chemicals)
- **2008-2012**: Rapid membership growth (180 → 550 families), additional washing stations (now 8 total)
- **2012-2018**: Quality improvements (84-87 point coffees), specialty market relationships, Rainforest Alliance certification
- **2018-2023**: Expansion to 750 families, experimentation with natural/honey processing, production 220-320 tons
- **Present**: Largest Zambian cooperative, 30-40% of national coffee production, recognized specialty quality

### Zambian Socioeconomic Context

**Extreme Poverty**:
Zambia, despite being classified as lower-middle-income country (due to copper revenues), has extreme poverty in rural areas:

- **Northern Province poverty rate**: 80%+ population below poverty line
- **Income**: Typical rural household income $200-600 annually
- **Food insecurity**: Chronic malnutrition, seasonal hunger (January-March "hunger months" pre-harvest)
- **Health**: High HIV/AIDS prevalence, malaria endemic, maternal/infant mortality high, life expectancy 63 years
- **Education**: 73% literacy nationally, lower in rural areas; secondary education often unaffordable

**Copper Economy and Regional Inequality**:
- Zambia's economy dominated by copper mining (70% export earnings)
- Copperbelt region (south-central) relatively developed, receives most investment
- Northern Province marginalized—minimal government investment, infrastructure neglect
- Economic collapse when copper prices fall (Zambia highly vulnerable to commodity price shocks)

**Alternative Livelihoods**:
- **Subsistence agriculture**: Majority of Northern Province farmers grow maize, cassava, beans for family consumption (little cash income)
- **Tobacco**: Profitable but environmentally devastating (deforestation for curing, soil depletion), health risks
- **Charcoal**: Cutting trees for charcoal production (environmental destruction, low income)
- **Migration**: Youth migrate to Copperbelt mines or Lusaka for wage labor (difficult conditions, family disruption)

**Coffee as Alternative**:
Kasama Cooperative promotes coffee as sustainable livelihood:
- Higher income than subsistence crops or charcoal
- Less environmentally destructive than tobacco
- Perennial crop (vs annual tobacco) reducing labor burden
- Organic systems building soil health vs tobacco's soil depletion
- Fair Trade premiums funding community development

## Organization and Structure

### Cooperative Governance

**Membership**:
- **Total members**: 750 families (grew from 180 in 2004)
- **Demographics**: Mix of ethnic groups (Bemba majority, Lungu, Namwanga, others)

- **Pre-harvest cash advances**: 30-40% of expected value paid during lean season (January-April before harvest)
- **Two-payment system**: Initial payment at cherry delivery + final payment after export (can be 6-12 months later due to slow export logistics)
- **Transparent pricing**: Members shown international FOB price, cooperative costs deducted, member payment calculated
- **Emergency loans**: Small loans for family crises (health, funeral, school fees)
- **Savings**: Voluntary savings program (members can save with cooperative, earning interest)

### Community Development (Fair Trade Premiums)

Kasama Cooperative invests Fair Trade social premiums ($0.20/lb above market price) plus portions of cooperative profits in community development addressing critical needs:

**Clean Water** (highest priority):
- **35 borehole wells** and protected springs built in member communities
- **Impact**: 12,000+ people (members + families + neighbors) accessing clean water
- **Health**: Dramatic reduction in waterborne disease (cholera, dysentery, typhoid—major killers in rural Zambia)
- **Women's time**: Women previously spent 3-5 hours daily fetching water from distant, contaminated sources; now available for income generation, education, rest
- **Examples**: Mungwi region (8 boreholes, 3,000 beneficiaries), Luwingu (6 boreholes, 2,200 beneficiaries)

**Education**:
- **School construction/renovation**: 15 primary schools built or renovated (classrooms, teacher housing, latrines, water)
- **Impact**: 5,000+ students in improved facilities
- **Scholarships**: 280+ annual scholarships for secondary school (boarding fees, uniforms, supplies)
- **School supplies**: Annual distribution to 2,000+ children (notebooks, pens, textbooks)
- **Teacher support**: Housing built for teachers willing to work in remote communities (attracting qualified teachers)

**Healthcare**:
- **Health clinics**: 6 rural health posts built or upgraded
- **Maternal health**: Birthing facilities, prenatal care reducing maternal/infant mortality
- **HIV/AIDS**: Testing, counseling, antiretroviral therapy (ART) access support
- **Malaria**: Bed net distribution, malaria prevention education, treatment support
- **Nutrition**: Programs addressing child malnutrition (supplementary feeding)

**Women's Empowerment**:
- **Women's savings groups**: 45 Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs)
- **Microfinance**: Small loans for income-generating projects (tailoring, small shops, vegetable gardening)
- **Literacy**: Women's literacy classes (Bemba and English)
- **Leadership training**: Women's leadership development programs

**Infrastructure**:
- **Roads**: Limited road grading/maintenance (cooperative has 1 tractor for members + some road work)
- **Maize mills**: 3 community maize mills (reducing women's labor pounding maize by hand)
- **Solar panels**: Cooperative office and some washing stations have solar power (demonstration for members)

These investments transform communities—addressing basic needs government services don't reach due to poverty and remoteness.

## Coffee Cultivation

### Smallholder Farm Characteristics

**Typical Member Farm**:
- **Coffee area**: 1-2 hectares (2.5-5 acres)
- **Total land**: 2-5 hectares (coffee + subsistence maize, cassava, beans)
- **Tree density**: 2,000-3,500 trees per hectare
- **Tree age**: Mixed—some trees from 1960s-1970s estate era (50+ years, declining), majority planted 1990s-2010s
- **Shade**: Variable—30-50% shade from native miombo trees, fruit trees (mango, avocado, banana), intercropped maize
- **Infrastructure**: Very basic—simple housing, small drying areas, hand tools, no electricity

**Organic Farming** (95% of members certified):

**Why Organic?**:
- **Economic necessity**: Members too poor to afford chemical fertilizers, pesticides (organic by default)
- **Traditional**: Zambian smallholders historically used minimal inputs
- **Market premium**: Organic certification enables $0.30-0.50/lb premium crucial for livelihood
- **Soil health**: Building long-term fertility vs temporary chemical boost

**Organic Practices**:
- **No synthetics**: No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides
- **Soil fertility**: Composting (coffee pulp from washing stations, crop residues, animal manure from chickens/goats), green manure cover crops (legumes)
- **Pest management**: Manual removal, botanical sprays (neem, garlic-chili), biological control (birds, beneficial insects)
- **Disease management**: Pruning for airflow, variety selection (Catimor rust-resistant), removing diseased material, organic copper sprays (permitted under organic rules)
- **Weed control**: Manual weeding with hand hoes, mulching, intercrop competition
- **Erosion control**: Contour planting, mulching, maintaining tree cover

**Cultivation Methods**:
- **Pruning**: Annual selective pruning; stumping every 7-10 years to rejuvenate aging trees
- **Fertilization**: 1-2 compost applications annually (after harvest, before rains)
- **Mulching**: Coffee pulp, crop residues spread around trees
- **Intercropping**: Coffee intercropped with beans, cassava, vegetables (maximizing land use, food security)
- **Replanting**: Gradual replacement of old, declining trees with cooperative nursery seedlings

**Labor**:
- **Family-based**: Husband, wife, children, extended family
- **Gender roles**: Men manage pruning, heavy work; women central to harvest (selective picking), processing; children help during school holidays
- **Seasonal patterns**: Coffee harvest (May-August) coincides with dry season; food crops harvested March-May
- **Migration**: Some family members migrate to Copperbelt mines during coffee off-season, return for harvest

**Challenges**:
- **Climate variability**: Increasingly irregular rainfall, delayed rains, mid-season droughts reducing yields
- **Coffee leaf rust** (roya): Serious threat, especially below 1,400m; organic management difficult
- **Old trees**: Many farms have 30-50 year old trees declining in productivity
- **Poverty**: Farmers lack capital for inputs, tools, replanting
- **Food security trade-off**: Limited land must balance coffee (cash crop) with food crops (survival)

### Varieties

**Variety Distribution**:

1. **Bourbon** (40-45% of production):
   - Traditional Zambian variety, inherited from colonial estates
   - Excellent cup quality (85-89 points), complex, balanced
- Moderate yields (900-1,400 kg/ha)
   - Rust-susceptible, requires careful management
   - Farmers maintain despite challenges due to quality premiums, heritage

2. **Catimor** (30-35%):
   - Rust-resistant hybrid (Caturra x Timor), introduced 1990s-2000s
   - Higher yields (1,200-2,000 kg/ha), critical for food-insecure farmers
   - Lower cup quality (82-85 points, occasionally 86 with excellent processing)
   - Economic necessity in rust-affected areas
   - Cooperative working to improve Catimor quality through processing

3. **Kenya (SL28/SL34)** (15-20%):
   - Kenyan varieties introduced 1980s-1990s, exceptional quality
   - SL28 and SL34 similar to Kenya's legendary coffees
   - Outstanding cup quality (86-90 points), bright fruit, floral complexity
   - Low yields (700-1,200 kg/ha), very rust-susceptible
   - Limited to highest altitudes (1,600-1,800m) on Muchinga Escarpment
   - Cooperative's premium micro-lots, highest prices

4. **Mundo Novo** (5-10%):
   - Brazilian variety, introduced for productivity
   - Good yields (1,200-1,800 kg/ha)
   - Moderate quality (83-86 points)
   - Some farmers prefer for economic security

**Kenyan Varieties as Zambian Signature**:
SL28 and SL34 grown in Zambia produce exceptional quality (86-90 points) with Kenyan-style bright acidity, blackcurrant-like fruit, floral complexity but with distinctive Zambian terroir (slightly more chocolate, balanced vs Kenya's extreme brightness). Specialty buyers value Zambian SL28/SL34 for quality+novelty (Kenya quality at potentially lower price, supporting less-known origin).

**Variety Strategy**:
- **Bourbon preservation**: Maintaining Bourbon for quality, heritage
- **Kenya focus**: Expanding SL28/SL34 at highest altitudes for premium micro-lots
- **Catimor pragmatism**: Accepting Catimor necessity for vulnerable farmers, improving through processing
- **Experimentation**: Some trial plots with disease-resistant varieties maintaining quality (F1 hybrids)

## Coffee Processing

### Washed Processing (Primary Method)

Approximately 85-90% of Kasama Cooperative coffee is fully washed, producing clean, bright, complex profiles.

**Harvest**:
- **Season**: May-September (peak June-August)
- **Selective picking**: Ripe red cherries only, multiple passes (3-5)
- **Transport**: Members carry cherries (20-40 kg loads on head or bicycle) to nearest washing station (can be 5-15 km walk)
- **Timing**: Processing within 24 hours critical

**Wet Processing at Washing Stations**:

1. **Cherry Reception and Sorting**:
   - Visual inspection, removal of underripe, overripe, damaged cherries
   - Flotation: Cherries floated in water—floaters (defects) removed, sinkers (quality) continue
   - Cherries weighed, farmers credited

2. **Pulping**:
   - Mechanical disc pulpers (mostly hand-crank or small diesel-powered; electricity rare)
   - Remove skin, most fruit pulp
   - Careful adjustment to avoid bean damage
   - Pulp collected for composting, returned to farmers

3. **Fermentation**:
   - Mucilage-covered beans fermented in concrete or plastic tanks 18-30 hours
   - Fermentation time varies by temperature (longer during cool dry season, shorter during warm periods)
   - Natural fermentation breaks down pectin mucilage
   - Careful monitoring prevents over-fermentation (creates sour, vinegar defects)

4. **Washing**:
   - Fermented beans washed in channels with clean water (boreholes or streams)
   - Multiple rinses, agitation to remove all mucilage
   - Density sorting (floaters removed)

5. **Drying**:
   - Washed parchment spread on raised beds (African-style mesh screen beds) or concrete patios
   - Thin layers (2-3 cm) for even drying
   - 12-20 days to 10.5-11.5% moisture (Zambia's dry season favorable for drying)
   - Turned every 2-3 hours during sun exposure
   - Covered at night (minimize moisture reabsorption)
   - Moisture carefully monitored

6. **Dry Parchment Storage**:
   - Stored at washing stations or transported to Kasama central warehouse
   - Rested 30-60 days to stabilize moisture

**Water and Infrastructure Challenges**:
- Many washing stations lack electricity (manual pulpers, gravity-fed water systems)
- Water access variable (boreholes when possible, streams otherwise)
- Dry season (harvest season) sometimes creates water scarcity
- Cooperative emphasizes water conservation, recirculation

### Centralized Quality Control (Kasama Central Facility)

Dry parchment from 8 washing stations transported to Kasama for final processing:

**Hulling**:
- Parchment mechanically removed (diesel-powered huller due to unreliable electricity)
- Careful to minimize bean breakage

**Grading and Sorting**:
- **Screen sorting**: Beans sorted by size (AA=screen 18+, A=17, AB=15-16)
- **Density sorting**: Gravity tables separate by density (manual or simple mechanical)
- **Hand-sorting**: Multiple rounds by trained women's teams removing defects
- **Quality focus**: Zambian coffee must be defect-free to compete; cooperative sorts exhaustively

**Cupping**:
- Quality control staff cup all export lots
- Identify premium micro-lots (Kenya varieties, highest altitudes, perfect processing)
- Verify no defects, off-flavors

**Export Preparation**:
- Packed in 60-kg jute bags or GrainPro bags
- Trucked to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania port (1,200 km, 3-day journey on poor roads—Northern Zambia landlocked, no rail access)
- Container shipping to Europe, North America

### Natural and Honey Processing (Experimental)

Since 2015, cooperative experimenting with natural and honey processing (10-15% of production):

**Natural Processing**:
- Whole cherries dried intact on raised beds
- 25-35 day drying
- Requires careful monitoring (defect risks)
- Produces fruit-forward, heavier body profile (84-88 points)
- Zambia's dry season (May-September) favorable for natural processing
- Growing specialty buyer interest

**Honey Processing**:
- Pulped cherries dried with partial (yellow) or full (red) mucilage
- 15-22 day drying
- Intermediate profile: more body/sweetness than washed, cleaner than natural (84-87 points)

**Processing Innovation**:
Cooperative partners with specialty buyers on experimental fermentation:
- Extended fermentation (48-72 hours)
- Anaerobic trials (limited oxygen)
- Results mixed—occasional exceptional lots (87-89 points) but high defect risk; learning curve

- **Asset accumulation**: Members investing in iron roofs (replacing thatch), bicycles, solar panels, livestock, children's education

**Community-Wide Benefits**:
Beyond individual income, cooperative's community investments benefit entire communities (members + non-members):

- **12,000+ people** accessing clean water from cooperative-funded boreholes
- **5,000+ children** in schools built/renovated by cooperative
- **Women's time liberation**: Clean water saves 3-5 hours daily previously spent fetching water
- **Health improvements**: Waterborne disease reduction, maternal health, malaria treatment

**Poverty Reduction**:
While members remain poor by global standards ($1,000-2,500 annual household income), cooperative membership associated with:
- Moving from extreme poverty ($1.90/day) to moderate poverty ($3-5/day)
- Improved food security (fewer "hunger months")
- Access to basic services (water, healthcare, education)
- Economic dignity vs exploitation

### Women's Empowerment

**Challenges**:
- Patriarchal traditional structures (men own land, control household decisions)
- Women do majority of agricultural labor (weeding, harvest, processing) but lack decision-making power
- Women-headed households (widows, single mothers) face discrimination in land access, credit

**Cooperative Initiatives**:

1. **Membership and Governance**:
   - 40% women members (increasing from ~25% at founding)
   - Board quota: 40% women (currently 5 of 13 board members)
   - Women's committee addressing specific concerns

2. **Economic Empowerment**:
   - **Processing employment**: Women preferentially hired for quality sorting, processing (60+ women employed seasonally)
   - **VSLAs**: 45 Village Savings and Loan Associations, 1,800+ women participating
   - **Microfinance**: Small loans for income-generating projects (tailoring, vegetable gardening, small shops)
   - **Direct payment**: Cooperative can pay women directly (not through husbands) if requested

3. **Capacity Building**:
   - Literacy classes (Bemba and English)
   - Business skills training
   - Leadership development

**Progress**:
- Women's economic agency increasing (controlling income, participating in decisions)
- Cultural change slow but occurring
- Women's representation on board strong (40%), governance participation improving

### Youth and Generational Transition

**Migration Challenge**:
- Youth leaving Northern Province for Copperbelt mines, Lusaka urban areas
- Average member age 48 years and rising
- Farming seen as low-status, difficult work
- Risk: Aging farmers without successors

**Cooperative Youth Strategy**:

1. **Economic Viability**:
   - Demonstrating coffee can provide decent income (vs subsistence farming or charcoal)
   - Processing employment for youth (quality control, administration)

2. **Education and Return**:
   - 280+ annual scholarships for secondary school
   - Preference for agricultural education (youth studying agriculture can return to manage family farms)
   - Internships at cooperative (administration, quality control, agronomy)
   - Creating professional coffee pathways (not just manual farm labor)

3. **Technology**:
   - Mobile phone record-keeping (where coverage exists)
   - Demonstrating coffee as modern, connected to global markets (vs "backward" subsistence farming perception)

**Results**:
- 10-15% members under 35 (increasing from <5% at founding)
- Some educated youth returning to take over family farms, attracted by coffee income
- Still challenging—migration continues, but trajectory improving

## Environmental Sustainability

### Organic Agriculture and Soil Health

**Environmental Benefits**:
- **No chemical contamination**: Protecting water, soil, biodiversity
- **Soil building**: Composting increasing soil organic matter (from 2-3% to 4-6% over years)
- **Carbon sequestration**: Organic soils sequester carbon, shade trees store carbon
- **Water quality**: No agricultural runoff contamination
- **Biodiversity**: Organic farms support more diverse soil microbes, insects, birds

**Soil Management**:
- **Coffee pulp composting**: Pulp from washing stations returned to farms as fertilizer (closes nutrient loop)
- **Animal integration**: Some farmers integrate chickens, goats providing manure
- **Green manure**: Legume cover crops (beans, lablab) between coffee rows fix nitrogen
- **Mulching**: Organic matter spread around trees
- **Erosion control**: Contour planting, maintaining tree cover

### Shade Coffee and Miombo Woodland

**Agroforestry Systems**:
Members use 30-50% shade from:
- **Native miombo trees**: Brachystegia, Julbernardia, Isoberlinia species retained or replanted
- **Fruit trees**: Mango, avocado, banana, papaya providing food and income
- **Nitrogen-fixing trees**: Leucaena, Gliricidia planted for soil fertility

**Biodiversity Benefits**:
- **Habitat**: Shade coffee provides habitat for birds, small mammals, insects
- **Miombo conservation**: Coffee farms buffer remaining miombo woodland, reduce conversion pressure
- **Pollination**: Diverse flowering trees support pollinators
- **Wildlife corridors**: Coffee farms create connectivity between forest fragments

**Conservation Context**:
- Miombo woodland facing deforestation pressure (charcoal, tobacco, agricultural expansion)
- Shade coffee provides economically viable alternative to clearing
- Some cooperative farms adjacent to forest reserves, national parks—functioning as buffer zones

### Water Protection

**Processing Water Management**:
- Washed processing requires significant water (8-10 L per kg cherry)
- Cooperative emphasizes:
  - **Pulp composting**: Prevents organic contamination of streams
  - **Settling tanks**: Wastewater treatment before discharge
  - **Water recirculation**: Where feasible, recirculating washing water
  - **Borehole protection**: Fencing, drainage protecting boreholes from contamination

**Community Water Projects**:
Cooperative's 35 boreholes provide clean water for processing and domestic use, reducing pressure on streams and preventing waterborne disease.

### Climate Change Adaptation

**Observed Impacts**:
- **Temperature increase**: ~0.8°C warming over 30 years
- **Rainfall variability**: Increasingly irregular rains, delayed onset, mid-season droughts
- **Extreme events**: More intense storms, occasional severe droughts (2015, 2019)
- **Pest/disease**: Coffee leaf rust expanding to higher elevations

**Threats to Coffee**:
- **Drought**: Severe drought causes cherry drop, tree stress, production collapse
- **Irregular rains**: Affecting flowering, fruit development
- **Rust**: Warming enabling rust at higher elevations, increasing pressure
- **Food security**: Climate stress on maize (staple food) creates competition with coffee for land

**Adaptation Strategies**:

1. **Variety Selection**:
   - Promoting rust-resistant Catimor for vulnerable areas
   - Maintaining Bourbon, Kenya at highest elevations (cooler, climate refuge)
   - Experimenting with drought-tolerant varieties

2. **Agroforestry**:
   - Increasing shade to buffer temperature extremes, reduce evaporation
   - Diverse tree species providing resilience

3. **Soil and Water Management**:
   - Mulching, organic matter improving water retention
   - Some farmers experimenting with water harvesting for dry season irrigation (limited but growing)

4. **Diversification**:
   - Fruit trees, vegetables providing income insurance if coffee fails
   - Traditional crop diversity (maize, cassava, beans) as climate buffer

5. **Altitude Shift**:
   - Encouraging new planting at higher elevations (1,600-1,800m on Muchinga Escarpment)
   - Abandoning lowest elevations (<1,300m) as rust pressure overwhelming
