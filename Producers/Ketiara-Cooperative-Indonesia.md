# Ketiara Cooperative

## Overview

Ketiara Cooperative (Koperasi Ketiara) represents a groundbreaking model for women's empowerment and gender equality in coffee—a women-owned and women-operated cooperative of 850 smallholder farmers in the Gayo Highlands of Sumatra, Indonesia, producing 300-500 tons of specialty Arabica coffee annually. Established in 2009 in the Takengon region of Aceh Province (1,100-1,600 MASL), Ketiara is one of Indonesia's first and most successful women-led coffee cooperatives, producing coffees scoring 83-88 points that showcase the distinctive earthy, herbal, syrupy characteristics of Gayo Arabica while pioneering washed processing alternatives to traditional wet-hulling (Giling Basah).

Ketiara's mission extends far beyond coffee production: the cooperative empowers women through economic independence, education, leadership training, and community development in a traditionally male-dominated agricultural sector. In Acehnese culture (Indonesia's most conservative Islamic region), women have historically been excluded from coffee production and sales—relegated to domestic work and unpaid farm labor. Ketiara challenged this by creating a women-only space where members control their own farms, participate in decision-making, access training and credit, and earn direct income. The cooperative's success has inspired women's coffee cooperatives across Indonesia and demonstrated that gender equality enhances coffee quality, family welfare, and community development.

Beyond social impact, Ketiara has gained international recognition for producing clean, specialty-grade Sumatran coffee that challenges stereotypes of "dirty" or "defect-ridden" Indonesian coffee. By training members in selective harvesting, quality processing, and post-harvest handling, and by offering both traditional wet-hulled and washed processing options, Ketiara produces coffees that appeal to specialty markets while maintaining the distinctive Sumatran character that many coffee lovers seek. The cooperative holds Fair Trade, Organic, and Rainforest Alliance certifications, commands significant premiums, and maintains direct relationships with specialty roasters who value both the coffee's quality and the cooperative's social mission.

## Location and Geography

### Gayo Highlands Context

**Gayo Highlands**: Mountainous region in central Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia's premier Arabica coffee region (95% of Sumatra's Arabica production)

**Takengon**: Principal town and coffee hub (population ~80,000), located on Lake Tawar shores at ~1,200 MASL

**Ketiara Territory**: Member farms located in villages surrounding Takengon (Bener Meriah and Aceh Tengah regencies)
- Elevation: 1,100-1,600 meters above sea level
- Higher elevations (1,400-1,600m) produce most complex, highest-scoring coffees
- Lower elevations (1,100-1,300m) higher yields, shorter maturation

**Microclimate**: Tropical mountain climate, equatorial (minimal seasonal variation)
- September-December: Primary harvest season (drier, but still frequent afternoon rain)
- January-August: Wet season, heavy rainfall (3,000-4,000mm annually)
- Temperature: 18-28°C (elevation-dependent, cool nights year-round)
- High humidity year-round (80-90%), frequent fog and mist
- Minimal dry season (challenges coffee drying—historically led to wet-hulling practice)

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Volcanic loam derived from ancient volcanic activity, fertile, high organic content, well-draining

**Topography**: Rolling hills and steep mountain slopes (20-50 degrees), terracing common

**Water**: Mountain springs, streams, and Lake Tawar watershed (abundant water year-round)

**Biodiversity**: Tropical mountain forests (significantly deforested, but remnant forests remain), Leuser Ecosystem nearby (UNESCO World Heritage Site, orangutan habitat)

## Cultural and Regional Context

### Aceh Province: Islamic Heritage and Conflict Recovery

**Aceh Identity**: Indonesia's westernmost province, only region with special autonomy to implement Sharia law (Islamic religious law), strongly Islamic culture and conservative social norms

**Coffee Heritage**: Arabica coffee introduced by Dutch colonial administration (1800s), Gayo people (indigenous ethnic group) adopted coffee as primary cash crop

**Aceh Conflict (1976-2005)**: 30-year separatist conflict (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka—Free Aceh Movement vs. Indonesian government)
- Devastating impact on communities: 15,000+ deaths, displacement, economic collapse
- Coffee farming continued throughout conflict (economic lifeline)
- 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (230,000+ deaths in Aceh) paradoxically facilitated peace process
- Peace agreement (2005) led to special autonomy, reconstruction, international development aid

**Women's Roles in Traditional Gayo Culture**: Historically restricted to domestic sphere, minimal participation in agriculture, no control over coffee sales, economic dependence on men

## Organization Structure and Founding Story

### Founding (2009): Women's Empowerment Movement

**Context**: Post-conflict reconstruction, international NGOs promote women's empowerment and economic development

**Founding Partners**:
- **Local women farmers**: 100+ women who worked on family coffee farms but had no ownership or decision-making power
- **Cooperative Coffees** (U.S.-based Fair Trade cooperative of roasters): Provided technical assistance and market access
- **Partnership for Developing Kampung/Village (PDK)**: Indonesian NGO focused on community development and gender equality

**Initial Vision**: Create a women-only cooperative where women could:
- Own and control their own farms (inherit or purchase land)
- Make production and sales decisions independently
- Access training in agronomy, processing, quality, business skills
- Earn direct income and open bank accounts (many had never controlled money)
- Participate in democratic governance and leadership

**Early Challenges**:
- Cultural resistance (families, community leaders questioned women's competence)
- Limited access to land (women inherited smaller plots, less productive land)
- Limited literacy and numeracy (many members had minimal formal education)
- Processing infrastructure needed (many small farms lacked pulpers, drying space)
- Quality inconsistency (traditional practices led to defects)

**Strategy**: Intensive training, collective infrastructure investment (shared wet mills and drying facilities), Fair Trade premiums invested in quality improvement and member services, international partnerships provided market access and technical support

### Membership and Governance (Current)

**Membership**: 850 women smallholder farmers (2024)
- Average farm size: 1-2 hectares (small plots, typical of Gayo region)
- 100% women-owned farms (requirement for membership)
- Members from 30+ villages surrounding Takengon
- Multi-generational (mothers and daughters sometimes both members)

**Governance**: Democratic cooperative structure
- General Assembly: All members vote on major decisions (budget, leadership, policies)
- Board of Directors: Elected by members, 7-member board (100% women), 3-year terms
- Management Team: Professional managers (quality control, processing, marketing, administration)
- Committee Structure: Quality Committee, Education Committee, Finance Committee (members volunteer)

**Member Services**:
- Technical training (agronomy, harvesting, processing, quality)
- Access to credit (pre-harvest loans, emergency loans)
- Input supply (organic fertilizers, tools, seedlings)
- Collective wet mill and drying facilities (for members lacking infrastructure)
- Health insurance and emergency fund (cooperative-supported)
- Education scholarships for members' children

## Farm Characteristics and Cultivation

### Varieties Grown

**Timor Hybrid** (60% of production):
- Arabica-Robusta natural hybrid (discovered Timor Island 1940s), disease-resistant (carries coffee leaf rust resistance genes)
- Primary variety in Gayo Highlands (introduced 1970s-80s, largely replaced traditional Typica)
- Hardier, higher-yielding than traditional Arabica, tolerates humidity and disease pressure
- Cupping profile: Full body, low acidity, earthy, herbal, chocolate, spice (typical Sumatran character)
- Productive but requires careful processing to avoid defects

**Ateng** (25% of production):
- Local name for Catimor (Caturra x Timor Hybrid), compact, high-yielding
- Introduced 1990s, higher productivity than Timor Hybrid
- Similar cup profile: earthy, syrupy body, herbal, chocolate

**Gayo 1** (10% of production):
- Locally selected variety (breeding work by Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute)
- Adapted to Gayo conditions, good yield and quality
- Clean cup potential (when processed carefully)

**Lini S-795** (5% of production):
- Indian variety (Arabica selection), introduced recently
- Better cup quality potential (brighter acidity, cleaner), lower yield
- Ketiara encourages members to experiment with this variety for specialty lots

### Agroforestry and Shade Management

**Shade Coverage** (average 45%, varies by farm):
- Mixed shade: fruit trees (durian, avocado, banana, mango, citrus), timber trees (Paraserianthes falcataria/sengon), leguminous nitrogen-fixers (*Inga* species, *Leucaena*)
- Shade benefits: Moderates temperature, slows maturation (improves complexity), reduces pest pressure, diversifies income (fruit sales)

**Organic Farming** (100% of members organic-certified):
- No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers (organic certification requirement)
- Compost from coffee pulp and processing waste
- Organic fertilizers (animal manure, plant-based)
- Biological pest control (shade, biodiversity, manual removal)

**Challenges**: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) pressure increasing (climate change, humidity), organic management requires more labor, some members struggle with lower yields

### Harvest Management

**Harvest Season**: September-December (peak October-November)

**Selective Picking**:
- Ketiara trains members in selective picking (only fully ripe cherries)
- Multiple passes (3-5) over season
- Quality improvement focus: Historically, Sumatran farmers often harvested all cherries at once (including underripe), leading to defects
- Ketiara pays members premiums for high-quality cherry (incentivizes selectivity)

**Cherry Delivery**: Members deliver cherries to cooperative's centralized wet mills (within 12 hours of harvest) or process at home (if they have adequate facilities) and deliver wet parchment

## Processing Methods: Giling Basah and Washed

### Traditional Giling Basah (Wet-Hulling) – 70% of Production

**Why Wet-Hulling Developed in Sumatra**:
- High humidity, minimal dry season makes traditional drying difficult (coffee molds if dried too slowly)
- Wet-hulling solution: Remove parchment while coffee still moist (30-40% moisture content), then finish drying green beans
- Speeds drying, prevents mold, developed organically by Sumatran farmers over decades

**Ketiara Giling Basah Process** (Improved Method):
1. **Cherry reception and sorting**: Float test removes underripe and defects, visual inspection
2. **Pulping**: Mechanical removal of skin and fruit (day of harvest)
3. **Fermentation**: Short fermentation (6-12 hours) to loosen mucilage, then washing (removes mucilage)
4. **Pre-drying in parchment**: Sun-drying on patios or raised beds for 1-2 days until moisture ~30-40%
5. **Hulling (wet)**: Parchment mechanically removed while beans still moist (unique to Giling Basah)
6. **Final drying**: Green beans dried to 12-13% moisture (2-3 days)
7. **Resting**: 30-60 days before export preparation
8. **Hand-sorting**: Multiple passes to remove defects (Ketiara's quality differentiation)

**Giling Basah Cup Profile**:
- **Body**: Full, syrupy, creamy, heavy (wet-hulling creates distinctive body)
- **Flavor**: Earthy, herbal, cedar, tobacco, dark chocolate, spice, savory
- **Acidity**: Low, muted (wet-hulling reduces acidity)
- **Sweetness**: Brown sugar, molasses, subtle
- **Unique character**: "Sumatra profile"—earthy, rustic, polarizing (some love it, others find it "dirty")

**Ketiara Quality Focus**: Training members to minimize defects, multiple hand-sorting stages, moisture management during drying (prevents mold, fermentation defects)

### Washed Process (Fully Washed) – 30% of Production (Growing)

**Why Ketiara Offers Washed**: Specialty market demand for cleaner, brighter Sumatran coffees, challenges stereotype of "defect-ridden" Indonesian coffee, achieves higher cupping scores

**Ketiara Washed Process**:
1. **Cherry reception and sorting**: Same as Giling Basah
2. **Pulping**: Mechanical removal of skin and fruit
3. **Fermentation**: 18-36 hours (full mucilage fermentation)
4. **Washing**: Thorough washing, density separation
5. **Drying in parchment**: Sun-drying on raised beds or patios, 12-18 days to 11-12% moisture (requires dry weather, challenging in Gayo's humid climate)
6. **Resting**: 60-90 days
7. **Dry milling**: Hulling, grading, hand-sorting

**Washed Cup Profile**:
- **Cleaner, brighter** than Giling Basah
- **Flavor**: Chocolate, caramel, nuts, herbal tea, mild fruit
- **Acidity**: Moderate, citrus, apple (brighter than wet-hulled)
- **Body**: Medium-full (lighter than wet-hulled)
- **Sweetness**: Brown sugar, caramel, more pronounced
- **Unique character**: Retains Sumatran earthiness but much cleaner, appeals to specialty market

**Challenge**: Washed processing requires longer drying time, vulnerable to rain and mold (Gayo's high humidity), requires better infrastructure (raised beds, covered drying areas), some members lack facilities

**Ketiara Investment**: Cooperative built centralized washed processing facility (covered drying areas, raised beds), members can deliver cherry for washed processing (cooperative pays premium for washed coffee)
