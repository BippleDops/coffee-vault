## 📝 Producer Story

The Kochere Cooperative was established in 1999 by a group of 200 smallholder farmers seeking better market access and fair prices. Located in the Yirgacheffe region at 1,850-2,100 meters elevation, the cooperative has grown to nearly 2,000 member farmers.

The cooperative operates a state-of-the-art washing station with eco-pulpers and water recycling systems. They've achieved organic certification for 100% of their production and maintain exceptional quality standards with daily cupping and lot separation.

Through direct trade relationships beginning in 2012, the cooperative has transformed the local economy. Farmers now receive 350% above commodity prices, enabling investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The cooperative has built 2 schools, established a healthcare clinic, and drilled 3 clean water wells serving the broader community.

The Kochere Cooperative is known for producing some of Ethiopia's finest washed Yirgacheffe coffees, with cupping scores regularly reaching 88-92 points. Their commitment to quality, sustainability, and social impact makes them a model cooperative in the specialty coffee industry.
