# CARCAFE (Cauca Regional Coffee Cooperative)

## Overview

CARCAFE (Cauca Regional Coffee Farmers Cooperative—Cooperativa Regional de Caficultores del Cauca) represents Colombia's indigenous coffee excellence—a cooperative of 1,800 smallholder families (60% indigenous Nasa and Misak peoples, 40% mestizo campesinos) across Cauca Department's volcanic highlands (1,700-2,100 MASL) producing 400-800 tons annually of exceptional specialty coffees scoring 85-92 points, with Fair Trade and Organic certification empowering indigenous communities, preserving Andean cultural heritage and ancestral lands, and demonstrating that Colombia's most conflict-affected regions can achieve world-class coffee quality while honoring indigenous identity and traditional ecological knowledge. Established 2005 during Colombia's coca-to-coffee substitution programs (government and international donors promoted coffee as legal alternative to coca cultivation in conflict zones), CARCAFE united indigenous communities and campesino families who had endured decades of armed conflict (guerrillas, paramilitaries, drug trafficking, displacement) under shared economic vision, achieved Fair Trade (2007) and Organic (2008) certification, and built direct relationships with specialty roasters who value both exceptional Cauca coffee quality and indigenous empowerment story.

Located in Cauca Department (southwestern Colombia, Pacific-facing Andes, one of Colombia's most culturally diverse and conflict-affected regions) on volcanic slopes surrounding Popayán (colonial-era city, Cauca's capital) and indigenous territories (resguardos—legally recognized indigenous reservations with autonomy), CARCAFE member families cultivate traditional Caturra and Typica alongside rust-resistant Castillo and Colombia varieties, plus experimental Geisha plantings, in indigenous forest-integrated agroforestry systems (50% shade from native Andean trees, medicinal plants, food crops—traditional Nasa and Misak cultivation practices). Cauca's exceptional terroir—extreme altitudes (1,700-2,100m, among Colombia's highest), young volcanic soils (active Puracé and Sotará volcanoes), dramatic diurnal temperature variation (15-20°C), and indigenous stewardship of ancestral lands—produces coffees with extraordinary brightness, complex fruit, floral notes, wine-like character, and exceptional cleanliness that consistently score 85-92 points and rival Colombia's most famous regions (Nariño, Huila, Antioquia).

Beyond coffee excellence, CARCAFE's significance lies in indigenous empowerment and post-conflict recovery: the cooperative provides 1,800 families (predominantly indigenous Nasa and Misak—historically marginalized, land-dispossessed, caught in armed conflict) with stable income, market access, and collective voice, while respecting indigenous autonomy, cultural practices, and traditional governance structures (cabildos—indigenous councils). Fair Trade and Organic premiums (~$0.50-0.70/lb combined above commodity prices) are democratically invested in indigenous-defined priorities: education (bilingual schools teaching Spanish and indigenous languages Nasa Yuwe, Namtrik), healthcare (intercultural health clinics combining Western and traditional medicine), land recovery (purchasing land for landless indigenous families), cultural preservation (traditional governance, ceremonies, language revitalization), and infrastructure (roads, clean water, processing facilities). CARCAFE demonstrates that specialty coffee can be vehicle for indigenous rights, cultural survival, and post-conflict economic development in one of Latin America's most complex and challenging environments.

## Location and Geography

### Cauca Department: Indigenous Heartland and Conflict Zone

**Cauca Department**: Southwestern Colombia, Pacific coast to Andean highlands, population ~1.5 million

**Geographic Diversity**: Cauca spans Pacific lowlands to Andes to Amazon basin transition (extreme geographic and climatic diversity)

**CARCAFE Territory**: Andean highlands surrounding Popayán, indigenous resguardos (territories) of Nasa and Misak peoples
- Municipalities: Popayán, Timbío, Rosas, La Sierra, Cajibío, Piendamó, Silvia, others
- Elevation: 1,700-2,100 meters above sea level (extreme altitudes, among Colombia's highest coffee cultivation)
- Higher elevations (1,900-2,100m): Slowest maturation, most complex coffees (10-11 months flower to harvest)

**Microclimate**: Andean highland climate, two rainy seasons (two harvests)
- **March-June**: Main harvest (follows primary rainy season September-December)
- **October-December**: Mitaca (secondary harvest, follows secondary rains April-June), smaller volume
- Annual rainfall: 2,000-3,000mm (distributed across two rainy seasons)
- Temperature: 12-24°C (cool year-round, cold nights at highest elevations)
- Volcanic mountains: Puracé (4,646m, active volcano) and Sotará (4,580m, active) dominate landscape
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (15-20°C at highest elevations), slows maturation, enhances complexity

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Young volcanic ash and loam from Puracé and Sotará eruptions, extremely fertile, mineral-rich (sulfur, phosphorus), well-draining

**Topography**: Extremely steep Andean slopes (40-70 degrees common), terracing essential, all cultivation manual (no mechanization)

**Water**: Mountain springs and streams from Andean páramo (high-altitude grassland ecosystem above treeline, critical watershed), abundant year-round

**Biodiversity—Andean Cloud Forest**: Cauca's indigenous territories include significant Andean forest conservation
- Endemic species: Spectacled bear (endangered, Andean icon), mountain tapir, puma, countless endemic birds, amphibians, plants
- Páramo ecosystems: High-altitude grasslands above 3,000m (critical water source, carbon storage, biodiversity hotspot, sacred to indigenous peoples)
- Deforestation threats: Armed conflict, coca cultivation, cattle ranching historically drove deforestation, indigenous communities now lead conservation

## Cultural and Historical Context: Indigenous Peoples and Conflict

### Nasa and Misak Indigenous Peoples

**Nasa People** (also called Páez):
- Population: ~200,000 (one of Colombia's largest indigenous groups)
- Language: Nasa Yuwe (Páez language, still spoken by majority of Nasa, especially elders and rural communities)
- Territory: Cauca highlands, especially Tierradentro region (UNESCO World Heritage Site—pre-Columbian archaeological sites)
- Traditional governance: Cabildos (indigenous councils, elected authorities manage resguardo affairs, customary law)
- Culture: Strong indigenous identity, resistance history (never fully conquered by Spanish colonizers, maintained autonomy), traditional medicine (shamans, plant knowledge), spiritual connection to land (mountains, water sacred)

**Misak People** (also called Guambiano):
- Population: ~20,000
- Language: Namtrik (Guambiano language, spoken by most Misak)
- Territory: Cauca highlands, especially around Silvia municipality
- Traditional governance: Cabildos
- Culture: Distinctive traditional dress (blue and pink ponchos, men and women), spiritual practices, agricultural knowledge, resistance history

**Indigenous Coffee History**:
- Coffee introduced to Cauca 1800s-early 1900s (Spanish colonizers, later Colombian state)
- Indigenous peoples initially resistant (coffee imposed on communal lands, disrupted traditional subsistence agriculture)
- 20th century: Indigenous families gradually adopted coffee as cash crop (economic necessity, but integrated into traditional systems—forest gardens, mixed with food crops, communal labor)

### Armed Conflict and Coca Cultivation (1960s-2016)

**Colombian Armed Conflict** (1960s-2016): Decades of violence between government, guerrillas (FARC, ELN), paramilitaries, drug traffickers
- Cauca among most conflict-affected regions (strategic location, coca cultivation, indigenous resistance)
- Casualties: Thousands killed, disappeared, displaced (indigenous communities disproportionately affected—caught between armed groups, massacres, forced displacement common)

**Coca Cultivation** (1980s-2000s): Cauca became major coca-growing region
- Armed groups (FARC guerrillas especially) controlled coca cultivation, taxation
- Many indigenous and campesino families grew coca (economic desperation, armed group coercion, coffee prices collapsed 1990s-2000s)
- Government militarization, fumigation campaigns (aerial spraying of coca fields with herbicides, destroyed food crops, health impacts, environmental damage)

**Indigenous Resistance**: Nasa and Misak communities organized resistance to armed conflict, coca cultivation, government militarization
- **Indigenous Guard** (Guardia Indígena): Unarmed community self-defense force (using traditional staffs, collective action, moral authority), protects indigenous territories from all armed groups, drug traffickers, government abuses
- Land recovery movements: Indigenous communities occupied large estates (reclaiming ancestral lands), established new resguardos
- **CRIC** (Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca, founded 1971): Indigenous organization advocating for land rights, autonomy, cultural preservation, became powerful political force

### Peace Process and Coffee Transition (2000s-Present)

**Coca-to-Coffee Substitution** (2000s-2010s): Colombian government and international donors (USAID, EU, others) promoted coca eradication, substitution with legal crops (coffee, cacao, others)
- Voluntary eradication programs: Families who eradicated coca received support (inputs, training, market access for coffee)
- Many indigenous and campesino families transitioned to coffee (economic alternative to coca, less conflict with government)

**CARCAFE Formation** (2005): Indigenous leaders and campesino farmer representatives organized cooperative
- Motivation: Coffee substitution programs provided opportunity, but families needed collective marketing, processing infrastructure, technical assistance
- Challenge: Organizing across indigenous communities (each resguardo autonomous, different cabildos, historical rivalries), bridging indigenous-campesino cultural differences

**Peace Accords** (2016): Colombian government and FARC guerrillas signed peace agreement, ending 52-year conflict (though ELN guerrillas and drug trafficking continue)

**Post-Conflict Context**: Cauca remains unstable (ELN, drug trafficking, land conflicts persist), but peace process enabled greater security, economic development opportunities (including coffee specialty market access)

## Organization Structure: Cooperative Respecting Indigenous Autonomy

### Governance: Balancing Cooperative and Indigenous Structures

**Membership**: 1,800 smallholder families
- **Indigenous members** (60%, ~1,080 families): Predominantly Nasa, some Misak, from various resguardos
- **Mestizo campesino members** (40%, ~720 families): Non-indigenous small farmers, neighboring indigenous territories
- Average farm size: 1-3 hectares (small plots, steep slopes)
- 40% women members (widows from conflict violence, women household heads, women landowners)

**Dual Governance**: CARCAFE navigates complex balance between cooperative democratic governance and indigenous autonomy

**Cooperative Level**:
- **General Assembly**: All members vote on major decisions (budget, leadership, certifications, premium allocation)
- **Board of Directors**: Elected representatives (ensures indigenous and campesino representation, gender balance), rotating terms
- **Management Team**: Professional staff (general manager, quality manager, field officers, accountant), some indigenous, some mestizo

**Indigenous Autonomy Respected**:
- **Cabildos**: Indigenous councils within each resguardo maintain authority over internal affairs (land use, dispute resolution, cultural practices)
- **Consultation**: Major cooperative decisions affecting indigenous members require consultation with cabildos (respect for indigenous governance)
- **Cultural Respect**: Cooperative meetings accommodate indigenous languages (translation), traditional governance norms (collective decision-making, consensus-building), ceremonies (opening rituals, offerings to Pachamama—Mother Earth)

### Member Services

**Technical Training**: Agronomy, organic farming, selective harvesting, processing, quality (field officers visit farms, conduct workshops in Spanish and indigenous languages)

**Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Cooperative respects and incorporates traditional agricultural knowledge (intercropping patterns, lunar planting cycles, natural pest management, medicinal plants)

**Input Supply**: Organic fertilizers, tools, seedlings (sold at cost or subsidized by Fair Trade premiums)

**Credit Programs**: Pre-harvest loans (interest-free or low-interest), emergency loans (health, family needs)

**Processing Infrastructure**: Cooperative operates 5 centralized wet mills (strategically located to serve member villages, indigenous territories)

**Social Programs**: Education, healthcare, cultural preservation, land recovery funded by Fair Trade premiums

## Farm Characteristics: Indigenous Agroforestry Integration

### Varieties: Traditional and Rust-Resistant

**Caturra** (40% of production, 1,700-2,000 MASL):
- Natural mutation of Bourbon, compact, productive, Colombia's workhorse variety
- Bright acidity, chocolate, caramel, fruit, clean, 85-89 points
- Susceptible to coffee leaf rust (CLR)—increasing challenge in Colombia

**Castillo** (30% of production, 1,700-1,900 MASL):
- Colombian variety (Caturra x Timor Hybrid, developed Cenicafé—Colombia's coffee research center), released 2005, CLR-resistant
- Compact, productive, rust-resistant (critical advantage as rust pressure increases)
- Cup quality: 84-88 points (good, slightly less complexity than Caturra, but acceptable for specialty)

**Colombia** (15% of production, 1,700-1,900 MASL):
- Colombian variety (Caturra x Timor Hybrid, similar to Castillo, released 1980s), CLR-resistant
- Productive, rust-resistant, 84-87 points

**Typica** (10% of production, 1,800-2,100 MASL):
- Traditional heirloom, planted by some indigenous families (heritage preservation), tall-growing, low-yielding
- Exceptional cup quality (87-91 points), bright, complex, floral, fruit-forward
- Susceptible to CLR, requires careful management

**Geisha** (5% of production, 1,900-2,100 MASL):
- Experimental plantings (some progressive members, cooperative support), highest elevations
- Extremely low-yielding, delicate, 90-92 points potential
- Floral, tropical fruit, tea-like, exceptional (Cauca's terroir suits Geisha, micro-lots command $15-30+/lb)

### Indigenous Agroforestry: Traditional Nasa and Misak Systems

**Shade Coverage** (50% average, higher than conventional Colombian coffee):
- **Native Andean trees**: Guamo (*Inga* species—nitrogen-fixing, traditional shade tree), Nogal (Andean walnut, timber value), native hardwoods
- **Medicinal plants**: Indigenous families cultivate medicinal plants alongside coffee (traditional healers use in ceremonies, treatments)
- **Food crops**: Plantain, banana, yuca, maize, beans intercropped with coffee (food security, subsistence integration)
- **Cultural plants**: Coca leaves (small plots for traditional ceremonial use—distinct from cocaine production coca fields, legal and culturally protected), tobacco, others

**Multi-Story Agroforestry**:
- Tall canopy (15-25m): Native trees, timber species
- Mid-story (8-15m): Fruit trees, medicinal plants
- Coffee layer (3-5m): Arabica coffee
- Understory: Food crops, ground covers, medicinal plants

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge**: Indigenous families apply generations of agricultural knowledge
- Lunar planting cycles (planting and harvesting timed to moon phases—traditional practice)
- Natural pest management (companion planting, botanical insecticides from medicinal plants)
- Soil fertility management (compost, crop rotation, nitrogen-fixing plants)

**Andean Forest Conservation**: Some indigenous resguardos maintain primary forest reserves (sacred sites, páramo watersheds, biodiversity), coffee cultivation buffers and protects forests

### Organic Farming (100% Certified)

**Organic Transition**: CARCAFE members transitioned to organic 2007-2008 (certification requirement, but many already organic by practice—couldn't afford synthetic inputs)

**Organic Practices**:
- No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers
- Compost from coffee pulp, animal manure, green manures
- Biological pest control (shade, biodiversity, botanical preparations from medicinal plants)
- CLR management challenge: Organic methods less effective than fungicides (pruning, shade management, resistant varieties like Castillo critical)

### Harvest Management

**Main Harvest**: March-June (peak April-May)

**Mitaca** (Secondary harvest): October-December (smaller volume)

**Selective Hand-Picking**: All coffee hand-picked (steep Andean slopes prohibit mechanization)
- Cooperative trains members in selective picking (only fully ripe cherries)
- 4-6 passes per tree over season
- Family and community labor (minga—traditional Nasa/Misak collective labor system, families help each other harvest)

**Cherry Delivery**: Members deliver cherry to cooperative collection points or centralized wet mills (within 24 hours), weighed and graded

**Transport Challenge**: Cauca's steep terrain, poor roads (some indigenous territories accessible only by foot or mule), cooperative contracts transport (difficult, expensive)

## Processing: Traditional Washed and Experimental Methods

### Centralized Wet Mills (5 Facilities)

**Infrastructure**: Cooperative operates 5 wet mills strategically located across member territories
- Processing capacity: 400-800 tons green equivalent per season (accommodates two harvests)
- Equipment: Mechanical pulpers (and eco-pulpers—water-saving technology), fermentation tanks, washing channels, drying beds and patios

### Traditional Colombian Washed Processing (75% of Production)

**Process Flow**:
1. Cherry reception and sorting (floatation removes defects, visual inspection)
2. Pulping (mechanical, day of harvest or next morning)
3. Fermentation (12-36 hours, cool highland temperatures slow fermentation)
4. Washing (multiple stages, clean mountain water from páramo watersheds)
5. Drying (patio drying or raised beds, 10-15 days to 11-12% moisture, frequent turning)
6. Resting (30-60 days in parchment)
7. Dry milling, grading, hand-sorting

**Washed Cup Profile**: Clean, bright, complex, chocolate, caramel, fruit, floral, wine-like, 85-91 points (Cauca's altitude and volcanic terroir produce exceptional brightness and complexity)

### Honey and Natural Processing (20% of Production, Growing)

**Honey Process** (Red, yellow honey):
- Introduced 2010s (specialty market demand, processing diversity)
- Sweet, fruit-forward, chocolate, caramel, full body, 86-90 points

**Natural Process** (Small volumes, experimental):
- Whole cherry dried on raised beds (15-25 days)
- Fruit-forward, berry, wine-like, complex, 87-91 points
- Challenging in Cauca's humid climate (mold risk), but cooperative experimenting

### Experimental Processing (5% of Production)

**Anaerobic Fermentation**: Sealed tanks, oxygen-free, 48-96 hours
- Tropical fruit, fermented complexity, wine-like, 88-92 points
- Ultra-premium micro-lots, direct trade roasters seek these

**Geisha Micro-lots**: Experimental Geisha processed with special care (washed or anaerobic)
- 90-92 points, $15-30/lb FOB potential, demonstrates Cauca's quality ceiling

**Fair Trade and Organic Premiums**: ~$0.50-0.70/lb combined, significant income boost
- Average member family: 1-2 hectares coffee, produces ~1,000-2,000 kg cherry annually (~200-400 kg green equivalent)
- Premiums generate ~$100-300 additional annual income per family (transformative when typical rural Colombian family earns <$3,000 annually)

**Conflict Recovery**: Coffee provides legal, stable income alternative to coca cultivation, reducing vulnerability to armed groups, drug trafficking

### Indigenous Rights and Cultural Preservation

**Land Recovery**: Fair Trade premiums fund land purchases (expanding indigenous resguardos, recovering ancestral lands)
- Indigenous communities historically dispossessed of lands (colonialism, conflict, land concentration), land recovery central to indigenous rights movement

**Bilingual Education**: Schools teaching Spanish and indigenous languages (Nasa Yuwe, Namtrik), indigenous history, traditional knowledge
- Language revitalization critical (indigenous languages endangered, Spanish dominance threatens cultural survival)
- 10+ schools funded, hundreds of children receiving bilingual education

**Intercultural Healthcare**: Clinics integrating Western medicine and traditional healing practices
- Traditional healers (médicos tradicionales) collaborate with doctors, nurses
- Medicinal plant gardens, traditional ceremonies respected
- Addresses cultural appropriateness, accessibility (many indigenous people distrust Western-only healthcare)

**Cabildos Support**: Cooperative invests in supporting indigenous governance (cabildo offices, legal assistance for land rights, indigenous rights advocacy)

**Ceremonies and Cultural Practices**: Cooperative respects and facilitates traditional ceremonies (harvest rituals, offerings to Pachamama, community gatherings)

### Women's Empowerment (40% Women Members)

**Conflict Widows**: Many women members widowed by armed conflict violence, now household heads managing coffee farms

**Economic Independence**: Cooperative membership provides women direct income (paid directly, not through husbands), financial independence

**Women's Programs**: Leadership training, business skills, literacy (Spanish and indigenous languages), gender-based violence prevention

**Cultural Norms**: Indigenous Nasa and Misak cultures relatively gender-egalitarian compared to mestizo Colombian norms, women participate actively in cabildos, cooperative governance

### Community Development and Infrastructure

**Clean Water**: Fair Trade premiums funded 40+ clean water systems (piped water, rainwater harvesting, water quality critical in rural areas)

**Roads**: Cooperative contributes to road maintenance (access to markets, reduces transport costs)

**Processing Facilities**: 5 wet mills built with Fair Trade and donor support, cooperative investment

**Community Centers**: Meeting spaces for cabildos, cooperatives, cultural events

## Challenges and Future Vision

### Armed Conflict and Insecurity (Ongoing)

**Post-Peace Accord Violence**: Despite 2016 FARC peace agreement, Cauca remains insecure
- ELN guerrillas active, drug trafficking continues, land conflicts escalate
- Indigenous communities continue facing violence, displacement threats

**Indigenous Guard Protection**: Guardia Indígena protects cooperative members, facilities (unarmed resistance, moral authority, community solidarity)

**Coffee as Peace-Building**: CARCAFE provides economic alternative to coca, armed group recruitment, demonstrating coffee's peace-building potential

### Climate Change and Coffee Leaf Rust

**Temperature Rise**: Average temperatures increasing, CLR pressure exploding (Colombia's rust epidemic 2008-2013 devastated production, recurring outbreaks)

**Rainfall Variability**: Rainy seasons less predictable, dry spells longer (stress on coffee, flowering disrupted)

**Adaptation**: Transition to Castillo and Colombia (rust-resistant), improved shade management (indigenous agroforestry provides resilience), climate-smart agronomy training

### Generational Transition

**Youth Migration**: Young indigenous people leaving rural areas (Popayán, Cali, Bogotá for education, employment)

**Cultural Tension**: Balancing traditional indigenous identity with modern opportunities (education, technology, urban life)

**Succession**: Cooperative developing youth engagement programs (demonstrating coffee provides viable livelihood, cultural pride, leadership opportunities)

### Market Access and Quality Consistency

**Quality Variability**: 1,800 families across dispersed territories, varied processing capacity, creates quality inconsistency (some lots exceptional 90+, others 85)

**Direct Trade Growth**: Building direct relationships with specialty roasters (higher premiums than Fair Trade minimum, but requires consistent quality, reliable supply, marketing capacity)

### Future Vision

**CARCAFE Mission**: Empower indigenous communities through coffee, preserve cultural heritage and ancestral lands, demonstrate post-conflict economic development is possible, produce world-class specialty coffee while honoring indigenous identity and traditional knowledge

**Goals**:
- Expand land recovery (purchasing land for landless indigenous families, expanding resguardos)
- Increase specialty quality and market access (training, processing infrastructure, direct trade relationships)
- Expand bilingual education and cultural preservation programs
- Climate adaptation (rust-resistant varieties, agroforestry, water conservation)
- Youth engagement (next generation indigenous coffee farmers and leaders)
- Indigenous rights advocacy (CARCAFE as platform for political voice, collective power)

**Legacy**: CARCAFE aims to be model for indigenous-led coffee cooperatives globally, demonstrate that specialty coffee can support indigenous rights, cultural survival, and environmental stewardship, inspire other post-conflict regions

## Visiting CARCAFE

### Origin Trips (Cultural Sensitivity Required)

**Roaster Visits**: CARCAFE welcomes roaster visits (advance coordination essential, cultural protocols must be observed)
- Indigenous territory visits (meet Nasa and Misak families, see traditional agroforestry, participate in minga—collective labor)
- Wet mill tours (processing demonstrations)
- Cupping sessions (quality evaluation)
- Cultural experiences (traditional ceremonies if appropriate, cabildos meetings with permission, traditional food, indigenous language learning)
- Indigenous Guard interactions (understand community self-defense, conflict context)

**Cultural Protocols**:
- Visitors must request permission from cabildos (indigenous authorities) before entering resguardos
- Respect indigenous customs (dress codes, photography restrictions, sacred sites off-limits)
- Cultural sensitivity essential (indigenous communities have been historically exploited, extractive relationships harmful, respectful partnership required)

**Security Considerations**: Cauca remains conflict-affected (armed groups, drug trafficking), cooperative provides security guidance, coordinates safe travel

**Logistics**: Popayán accessible from Bogotá (1-hour flight or 12-hour drive), indigenous territories 1-4 hours from Popayán (4WD required, rough mountain roads)

**Best Time**: March-June (main harvest, processing active), or October-December (mitaca harvest)

### Contact Information

**Location**: Various indigenous resguardos and campesino villages, Cauca Department, Colombia (cooperative office in Popayán)

**Contact**: Email, phone available through Fair Trade importers or direct inquiry
