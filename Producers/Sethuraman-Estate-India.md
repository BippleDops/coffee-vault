## 🔬 Processing Methods (Including Monsoon Processing)

Sethuraman Estate employs multiple processing methods, including unique Indian monsoon processing.

**1. Washed Process** (40% of production)

**Traditional Indian Washed**:

Standard washed processing with Indian characteristics:

1. Selective harvest → 2. Floatation sorting → 3. Depulping → 4. Fermentation (18-24 hours, warm humid climate) → 5. Washing → 6. Drying (patios, mechanical backup given rainfall) → 7. Resting → 8. Dry milling

**2. Natural Process** (20% of production)

Natural processing in monsoon climate:

Challenges:
- High humidity (mold risk)
- Frequent rain (drying interruption)
- Requires covered drying or mechanical dryers

Implementation:
- Selective cherry sorting
- Covered raised beds (rain protection)
- Mechanical dryers (humidity management)
- Extended drying (20-25+ days given humidity)
- Creates fruit-forward profile

**3. Monsoon Processing** (Monsoon Malabar) (30% of production)

**India's Unique Innovation**:

**Historical Origin**:
- Colonial era (1800s): Coffee shipped to Europe via sailing ships
- Months-long voyage around Cape of Good Hope
- Exposed to monsoon winds and sea air
- Coffee transformed: beans swelled, yellowed, flavor changed
- Europeans developed taste for "monsoon" coffee
- After steamships (faster voyage), Europeans demanded traditional monsoon flavor
- Indians developed intentional monsoon processing to recreate effect

**Modern Monsoon Processing** (Sethuraman Method):

1. **Base Coffee**: Typically lower-grade Arabica or Robusta

2. **Timing**: June-September (southwest monsoon season)

3. **Exposure**:
   - Coffee spread in open-sided warehouses
   - Exposed to monsoon winds (high humidity, rain-laden air)
   - Beans absorb moisture, swell
   - Color changes from green to pale yellow/gold
   - 4-6 weeks exposure

4. **Raking**: Coffee raked regularly (every few days) for even exposure

5. **Moisture Management**:
   - Beans swell with moisture absorption
   - Monitored carefully (too much = mold, too little = insufficient monsoon effect)
   - Final moisture: 13-14% (higher than standard 10-11%)

6. **Bulking**: Beans increase size (swell), become pale yellow, brittle

7. **Sorting**: Post-monsoon sorting (defect removal, grading)

**Monsoon Coffee Characteristics**:
- Pale yellow/golden color (vs normal green)
- Low acidity (monsoon process mutes acidity)
- Heavy body, syrupy
- Earthy, woody, spicy notes
- Chocolate, tobacco undertones
- Mellow, smooth, aged-like character
- Unique, polarizing profile

**Market**:
- Domestic Indian market (tradition, preference)
- International specialty (curiosity, heritage method)
- Espresso blends (low acidity, heavy body)
- Aged coffee enthusiasts

**4. Honey Process** (10% - Recent Innovation)

Limited honey processing experiments:
- Yellow/red honey variations
- Specialty roaster interest
- Challenging in humid climate (careful moisture management)
- Premium pricing potential

**Processing Infrastructure**:
- Wet mill (depulpers, fermentation tanks, washing channels)
- Drying infrastructure:
  - Concrete patios
  - Covered drying areas (rain protection)
  - Mechanical dryers (monsoon season essential)
- Monsoon facility:
  - Open-sided warehouses
  - Raking equipment
  - Moisture monitoring
- Storage facilities (parchment, green, monsoon coffee)
- Quality lab (cupping, roasting)

**Quality Control**:
- Cherry sorting (floatation, visual)
- Fermentation monitoring
- Drying moisture checks (daily, critical in humid climate)
- Hand-sorting during drying and post-milling
- Lot separation (variety, process, quality)
- Cupping evaluation (all lots)
- Monsoon process monitoring (moisture, exposure time, raking)
