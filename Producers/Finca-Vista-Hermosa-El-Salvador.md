## 🔬 Processing - Honey Process Innovation

Vista Hermosa is a Central American honey processing pioneer, producing exceptional honey coffees since 2008.

**Processing Methods Distribution**:
- **Honey Process** (60%): Primary focus, innovation leader
- **Natural Process** (25%): Growing, dry season only
- **Washed Process** (15%): Market diversity

**Honey Processing Innovation**:

**What is Honey Processing?**
- Skin removed (like washed), mucilage retained (like natural)
- Drying with sticky mucilage on parchment
- "Honey" refers to sticky feel, not flavor
- Originated in Costa Rica, perfected in El Salvador

**Vista Hermosa Honey Variations**:

1. **White Honey** (10% mucilage retained):
   - Light processing, closer to washed
   - 10-12 days drying
   - Cup: Clean, bright, balanced

2. **Yellow Honey** (25-50% mucilage):
   - Partial mucilage retained
   - 12-16 days drying
   - Cup: Sweetness increase, balanced body

3. **Red Honey** (50-75% mucilage):
   - Most mucilage retained
   - 16-20 days drying
   - Cup: Full sweetness, fruit notes, fuller body

4. **Black Honey** (75-100% mucilage):
   - Maximum mucilage retention
   - 20-25 days drying
   - Minimal turning (fermentation development)
   - Cup: Intense sweetness, fruit complexity, full body

**Honey Processing Protocol** (Red Honey Example):

1. **Selective Harvesting**:
   - Only ripe cherries (crucial for honey)
   - Same-day processing requirement

2. **Reception & Sorting**:
   - Quality inspection
   - Underripe/defects removed
   - Flotation (density sorting)

3. **Pulping**:
   - Mechanical pulper, precise settings
   - Skin removal only
   - Mucilage retention control (50-75% for red honey)

4. **Drying Phase 1** (Days 1-7):
   - Raised African beds or patios
   - Thin layers (sticky parchment)
   - Turned carefully (every 1-2 hours initially)
   - Prevent over-fermentation
   - Temperature monitoring

5. **Drying Phase 2** (Days 8-16):
   - Continued drying
   - Reduced turning (every 3-4 hours)
   - Moisture reduction (to 11%)
   - Color development (red honey darkens)

6. **Final Drying** (Days 14-20):
   - Target moisture: 10.5-11%
   - Hand-sorting during drying (defect removal)
   - Quality inspection

7. **Resting**:
   - Parchment rest 30-60 days
   - Moisture stabilization
   - Flavor maturation

**Natural Process** (25%):
- Whole cherry drying
- Raised beds exclusively
- 25-30 days drying
- Dry season only (Nov-Mar)
- Frequent turning (prevent over-fermentation)
- Creates fruit-forward profiles

**Washed Process** (15%):
- Traditional fully washed
- Fermentation 12-18 hours
- Complete washing
- 10-14 days drying
- Clean, bright profile

**Processing Infrastructure**:

- **Wet Mill**: Honey processing focus, precise control
- **Pulper**: Adjustable mechanical pulper (mucilage control)
- **Raised Beds**: 80+ African raised beds
- **Patios**: 3,000 square meters concrete drying
- **Greenhouse Tables**: Rain protection (wet season occasional)
- **Mechanical Dryers**: Backup/finishing
- **Storage**: Climate-controlled warehouses
- **Laboratory**: Cupping lab, moisture testing, quality control

**Quality Control**:
- Cherry ripeness inspection (reception)
- Flotation density sorting
- Moisture monitoring (multiple daily)
- Hand-sorting during drying (3-4 passes)
- Sample roasting and cupping throughout
- Pre-export cupping (quality grading)
- Lot traceability (day, variety, process, zone)

**Weather Management**:
Dry season (Nov-Mar) ideal for honey/natural:
- Minimal rain risk
- Consistent temperatures
- Predictable drying times
- Quality consistency

Occasional wet season rain:
- Greenhouse protection
- Mechanical dryers backup
- Careful moisture monitoring
