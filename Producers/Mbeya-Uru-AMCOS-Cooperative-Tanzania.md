## 🔬 Processing Methods (Washing Station Excellence)

**Centralized Washing Station Processing**:

Uru Washing Station processes all member coffee:

**1. Washed Process** (100% of production)

**Cherry Reception** (Day of Picking):

1. **Delivery**:
   - Members deliver cherry same day as picked
   - Washing station operates during harvest season
   - Cherry weighed upon arrival (payment calculation)

2. **Cherry Sorting**:
   - Floatation tanks (remove underripes, floaters, defects)
   - Visual hand-sorting
   - Reject cherry returned or discounted
   - Quality incentive (higher price for ripe cherry)

3. **Depulping** (Within 6 hours):
   - Mechanical disc pulpers
   - Skin removed, mucilage retained
   - Parchment coffee separated

4. **Fermentation** (18-24 hours):
   - Concrete fermentation tanks
   - Natural enzymatic mucilage breakdown
   - Cool highland altitude = longer fermentation
   - Monitored by touch, smell, pH testing
   - Timing critical for quality

5. **Washing**:
   - Clean water (river source, mountain streams)
   - Multiple wash cycles
   - Washing channels with density sorting (grade separation)
   - Float/density grading (AA, AB, etc.)
   - Final rinse until completely clean

6. **Drying** (10-15 days):
   - Raised African beds (mesh for airflow)
   - Thin, even layers (2-3 cm)
   - Turned regularly (every 2-3 hours initially)
   - Hand-sorted during drying (continuous defect removal)
   - Covered at night (dew protection)
   - Covered during rain
   - Target moisture: 10-11%

7. **Resting**:
   - 30-60 days in parchment
   - Flavor stabilization
