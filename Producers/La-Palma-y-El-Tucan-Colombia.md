# La Palma y El Tucan (LPET) - Colombia

## Overview

La Palma y El Tucan (LPET—"The Palm and The Toucan") stands as one of the global specialty coffee industry's most influential experimental processing laboratories, quality innovators, and creative forces—a vertically integrated Colombian estate and collaborative processing facility in the cloud forests of Zipaquirá, Cundinamarca (40 kilometers north of Bogotá) that has revolutionized coffee processing through radical experimentation with anaerobic fermentation, carbonic maceration, yeast inoculation, lactic acid fermentation, koji fermentation, and countless other controlled fermentation protocols while achieving consistent cupping scores of 88-94 points and commanding auction prices of $50-200+ per pound for ultra-premium experimental micro-lots. Founded in 2011 by Elisa Maria Madriñán de Koppel (Colombian coffee professional and artist) and Alejandro Renjifo (agronomist and quality visionary), LPET cultivates Geisha, Sudan Rume, Pink Bourbon, Sidra, Wush Wush, traditional Caturra/Castillo and other exotic varieties across 35 hectares of steep mountainside at 1,600-2,050 meters, produces 35-65 tons annually through 50+ distinct processing protocols, and has fundamentally influenced how the specialty coffee industry understands fermentation, terroir manipulation, and the boundaries between coffee agriculture and culinary art.

Unlike traditional Colombian cooperatives focused on volume, consistency, and established methods, LPET operates as research and development facility, quality atelier, and creative laboratory where every harvest involves systematic experimentation: isolating variables (fermentation time, temperature, yeast strains, oxygen levels, cherry preparation methods), documenting protocols exhaustively, cupping obsessively (often 100+ samples weekly), and pushing processing boundaries to explore coffee's flavor potential. The farm employs full-time quality team including Q-graders, sensory scientists, microbiologists, and processing specialists who treat coffee fermentation with precision comparable to winemaking or culinary fermentation, maintaining sterile conditions, inoculating with specific microorganisms, monitoring pH/temperature/Brix constantly, and creating flavor profiles previously impossible or accidental. This approach has generated both extraordinary success—Best of Panama-level prices, international acclaim, influence on processing innovation globally—and controversy within specialty coffee about "natural" vs "manipulated" flavors, terroir authenticity, sustainability of labor-intensive ultra-premium production, and whether LPET represents coffee's future or niche luxury disconnected from smallholder realities.

Beyond processing innovation, LPET has pioneered models of sustainability and social impact: employing 60-80 full-time workers year-round (vs seasonal labor typical in coffee), providing living wages, healthcare, education support, and professional development; collaborating with 40+ neighboring smallholder farmers through contract purchasing, processing services, and knowledge transfer; and developing biodiversity conservation programs protecting cloud forest ecosystems on the 100+ hectare property surrounding coffee cultivation. LPET's founders explicitly position the project as demonstrating specialty coffee's economic viability for producers—proving farmers can achieve prosperity through quality and innovation rather than volume, challenging Colombia's coffee poverty trap where smallholders produce commodity Arabica earning $1.50-2.50/lb while struggling to survive.

## Location and Geography

### Cundinamarca Cloud Forests, Eastern Cordillera

Cundinamarca Department surrounds Colombia's capital Bogotá, occupying the high Andean plateau (Sabana de Bogotá at 2,600m) and the steep eastern slopes of the Eastern Cordillera where elevation descends from 3,000+ meter páramo (high-altitude moorland) to 1,000-2,000m subtropical valleys. LPET sits on these dramatic cloud forest slopes in Zipaquirá municipality, 40 kilometers north of Bogotá and 15 kilometers west of the famous Zipaquirá Salt Cathedral.

  - Field workers: ~$500-700/month (vs $350-450 typical)
  - Processing staff: ~$600-900/month
  - Professionals (Q-graders, agronomists): $1,200-2,500/month
- **Healthcare**: Comprehensive health insurance for workers and families
- **Education support**: Scholarships for workers' children (primary, secondary, vocational, some university)
- **Housing**: On-site housing for 20-30 workers (families from distant areas)
- **Meals**: Subsidized meals on-site (lunch for all workers, breakfast/dinner for on-site residents)
- **Professional development**: Training, courses, certification support (Q-grader, agronomy, cupping)
- **Stability**: Year-round employment (not seasonal) provides income security

**Labor Philosophy**:
- **Fair labor as quality strategy**: Well-compensated, stable workforce more motivated, skilled, careful—directly impacts quality
- **Professionalization**: Positioning coffee work as skilled profession requiring training, expertise (not unskilled labor)
- **Retention**: Low turnover (workers stay years, accumulating expertise)—vs high turnover typical in exploitative seasonal labor systems
- **Community impact**: 60-80 families supported with stable, decent incomes
- **Demonstration**: Proving specialty coffee economics can support fair labor while remaining profitable

**Challenges**:
- **High labor costs**: LPET's labor costs 2-3x typical Colombian coffee farm (sustainable only with ultra-premium prices)
- **Scalability**: Labor model difficult to scale (requires prices $5-100+/lb; most coffee sells $1.50-3.50)
- **Replicability**: Most Colombian farmers cannot afford this model without access to specialty premiums

### Smallholder Partnership Program

**Collaboration with Neighboring Farmers** (40+ families):
LPET partners with ~40 smallholder families in surrounding areas:

**Partnership Model**:
1. **Cherry purchasing**: LPET buys cherry from smallholders at premium prices ($0.50-1.50/lb cherry depending on quality, variety—vs $0.30-0.50 FNC price)
2. **Processing services**: LPET processes smallholder cherry using its infrastructure, expertise (farmers lack processing capacity, knowledge)
3. **Quality premiums**: Selective picking, variety-specific premiums incentivize quality
4. **Technical assistance**: LPET agronomists provide training, inputs, seedlings to partner farmers
5. **Market access**: LPET markets smallholder-origin coffee (separately traceable) to buyers seeking inclusive models
6. **Knowledge transfer**: Farmers learn from LPET's methods (some experimentation done with smallholder cherry)

**Benefits for Smallholders**:
- **Higher income**: 50-150% price premiums vs FNC
- **Market access**: Entry to specialty market (impossible individually)
- **Processing quality**: Professional processing they cannot achieve on farms
- **Training**: Improving cultivation practices, yields, quality
- **Stability**: Long-term relationship, reliable buyer

**Benefits for LPET**:
- **Volume**: Supplementing estate production (35-65 tons estate + 15-30 tons smallholder = 50-95 tons total)
- **Social impact**: Demonstrating inclusive specialty coffee model (not just wealthy estate)
- **Experimentation**: Additional cherry for processing trials
- **Community relations**: Positive relationships with neighbors, local community

**Challenges**:
- **Quality variability**: Smallholder farms vary in management, inputs (not fully controlled like estate)
- **Traceability complexity**: Differentiating smallholder vs estate coffee in marketing
- **Limited reach**: 40 families small fraction of Cundinamarca's coffee farmers
- **Dependency risk**: Smallholders dependent on LPET; if LPET stops buying, they lose specialty access

## Coffee Cultivation—Variety Diversity and Terroir

### Estate Farming and Variety Collection

**Cultivation Practices**:
- **Terracing**: Steep slopes terraced for erosion control, tree access
- **Shade**: 30-50% shade from native trees (Inga, Nogal, others), planted shade (Guamo, Cedrela)
- **Density**: 4,000-6,000 trees per hectare (depending on variety, shade level, spacing)
- **Pruning**: Intensive—annual selective pruning, stumping rotation every 5-7 years
- **Fertilization**: Organic-synthetic hybrid—compost, coffee pulp, chemical fertilizers applied based on soil tests
- **Pest management**: Integrated pest management (IPM)—coffee berry borer traps, manual removal, limited pesticides
- **Disease management**: Coffee leaf rust (roya) managed through resistant varieties (Castillo), copper sprays, sanitation
- **Soil conservation**: Mulching, cover crops, terracing, maintaining shade trees
- **Record-keeping**: Exhaustive—every block GPS-mapped, digitally recorded (variety, planting date, inputs, yields, harvest dates)

## Coffee Processing—The Innovation Laboratory

### Processing Philosophy and Infrastructure

**LPET's Processing Philosophy**:
Coffee processing is controlled fermentation—manipulating variables (microorganisms, oxygen, temperature, time, pH, sugars) to create desired flavor outcomes, analogous to winemaking, brewing, culinary fermentation. Traditional coffee processing left fermentation largely to chance (ambient microbes, uncontrolled conditions); LPET controls fermentation scientifically, creating consistent, novel, exceptional flavors.

**Processing Infrastructure** (Extensive, Specialized):

**Wet Processing Mill**:
- Mechanical pulpers (multiple sizes for different cherry volumes, varieties)
- Eco-pulpers (water-efficient)
- Depulpers with adjustable settings (for specific experimental methods)

**Fermentation Facilities** (Critical, Specialized):
- **Open fermentation tanks** (20+ tanks, various sizes): Traditional open-air fermentation
- **Sealed anaerobic tanks** (15+ tanks, 100-500 kg capacity each): Airtight fermentation (no oxygen), pressure valves
- **Temperature-controlled rooms** (3 rooms): Refrigerated, heated, maintain precise temperatures (10°C to 35°C)
- **Carbonic maceration chambers**: Sealed tanks with CO2 injection
- **pH/temperature/Brix monitoring**: Digital sensors, real-time monitoring, data logging
- **Yeast/bacteria inoculation equipment**: Sterile conditions, precise culture addition
- **Lab facilities**: Microscopes, pH meters, refractometers, microbiological equipment

**Drying Infrastructure** (Extensive, Diverse):
- **Raised drying beds** (African beds): 300+ tables, mesh screens, sun-drying
- **Parabolic solar dryers** (greenhouse-style): Accelerate drying, weather protection
- **Mechanical dryers** (Guardiola, others): Controlled temperature drying, uniform moisture
- **Covered drying patios**: Cement patios under roofs, rain protection
- **Drying monitoring**: Moisture meters, temperature sensors, hourly moisture checks

**Dry Mill and Quality Control**:
- Hulling equipment (parchment removal)
- Screen sorting (size separation)
- Density sorting (gravity tables)
- Electronic color sorting (defect removal)
- Hand-sorting tables (final defect removal by trained workers—LPET employs 12-15 women full-time for hand-sorting)
- Cupping lab: Professional roasters (multiple), cupping tables (8-12 stations), Q-graders cupping 100+ samples weekly

**Storage**:
- Climate-controlled warehouses (temperature, humidity control preserving green bean freshness)
- GrainPro bags (hermetic storage preventing moisture, oxygen degradation)

### Processing Methods—50+ Protocols

LPET produces 50+ distinct processing protocols annually. Detailed examples:

**Traditional Washed** (15-20% of production):
- Cherry pulped, fermented 18-24 hours (open tanks), washed, dried on raised beds
- Baseline: Clean, bright, varietal character expressed, 85-89 points (Geisha 88-91)
- Purpose: Control group for experimentation comparison, some buyers preferring classic profiles

**Extended Fermentation Washed**:
- Cherry pulped, fermented 36-72 hours (longer than traditional)
- Develops deeper fruit, winey complexity, 86-90 points
- Risk: Over-fermentation creates sour, vinegar defects if not carefully monitored

**Anaerobic Natural**:
- Whole cherries sealed in anaerobic tanks, fermented 48-96 hours (no oxygen, CO2 atmosphere)
- Oxygen-free environment creates lactic acid bacteria dominance, unique fermentation pathway
- Then dried with fruit intact (natural method)
- Flavor: Intense fruit (berry, tropical, stone fruit), winey, funky, complex, 88-92 points
- Risk: High defect potential (mold, over-fermentation, alcoholic notes)

**Carbonic Maceration** (Wine-Inspired):
- Whole cherries placed in sealed tanks, CO2 injected (displacing oxygen)
- Intracellular fermentation (fermentation inside intact cherries before cell walls rupture)
- Duration: 5-10 days typically
- Then pulped, washed or dried as natural
- Flavor: Bubble gum, tropical fruit, floral, unique aromatic intensity, 89-93 points
- LPET pioneered in coffee (technique common in wine—Beaujolais)

**Lactic Acid Fermentation**:
- Pulped beans inoculated with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus strains)
- Fermented 24-48 hours (anaerobic or aerobic)
- Creates lactic acid (yogurt-like, creamy) flavor components
- Flavor: Creamy, dairy (yogurt, cream), fruit, unusual mouthfeel, 87-91 points

**Yeast Inoculation Methods**:
- Pulped beans or whole cherries inoculated with specific yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae variants, wine yeasts, others)
- Controlled fermentation (temperature, time, oxygen) with known yeast
- Creates consistent, reproducible fermentation outcomes (vs wild yeast variability)
- Flavor: Depends on yeast strain—some create tropical fruit, others stone fruit, others floral, winey notes; 88-92 points

**Koji Fermentation** (Experimental, Rare):
- Using koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae—used in sake, miso, soy sauce production)
- Koji spores applied to pulped beans, fermented 24-48 hours
- Enzymatic breakdown creates umami, savory, sweet complexity
- Flavor: Umami, savory-sweet, unusual (polarizing), fruit, 87-91 points
- Extremely rare in coffee—LPET one of very few experimenters globally

**Thermal Shock / Freeze-Thaw**:
- Cherries or pulped beans subjected to rapid temperature changes (freezing, then warming)
- Cell wall rupture accelerates fermentation, flavor compound release
- Flavor: Intense, concentrated, 88-90 points
- Experimental, limited quantities

**Honey Processing Variants**:
- Pulped cherries dried with mucilage partially or fully intact
- **White honey** (10-25% mucilage), **yellow honey** (25-50%), **red honey** (50-75%), **black honey** (75-100%)
- Different mucilage levels create sweetness, body, fruit intensity gradients
- Flavor: 85-89 points, depends on mucilage level and drying speed
