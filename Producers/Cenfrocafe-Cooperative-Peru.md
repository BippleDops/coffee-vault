## 🏛️ Organization Structure

**Organization Type**: Second-Tier Smallholder Cooperative
**Established**: 1999
**Legal Structure**: Registered Peruvian Cooperative
**Membership**: 3,200+ families across 60+ communities
**Average Member Farm**: 1-3 hectares (smallholder scale)
**Democratic Governance**: Village groups elect zone representatives, zones elect central board
**Total Productive Area**: ~8,000 hectares collective

**Peruvian Coffee Context**:
Peru is major specialty coffee origin - high altitude, organic leadership, Fair Trade pioneer. Unlike industrialized Brazil or large-estate Guatemala, Peru is smallholder-dominated. Cooperatives like CENFROCAFE provide crucial market access, quality training, certification support, and fair pricing for small farmers who couldn't participate in specialty market individually.

**Cajamarca Region Significance**:
Northern Peru's Cajamarca region (especially Jaén and San Ignacio provinces) produces Peru's premier coffee:
- High altitude (1,200-2,000m)
- Diverse microclimates
- Shade-grown traditional cultivation
- Organic by practice (limited resources for chemicals)
- Smallholder dominance
- Fair Trade and Organic leadership
- Growing specialty reputation

**Cooperative Formation** (1999):

CENFROCAFE formed during coffee price crisis when smallholders faced:
- Devastating low commodity prices ($0.60-0.80/lb)
- Exploitative intermediaries controlling local trade
- No quality incentives or premiums
- Poverty and potential crop abandonment
- Limited access to credit, training, or market information

Farmers organized democratic cooperative to:
- Eliminate intermediary exploitation
- Access Fair Trade and Organic markets
- Invest collectively in quality and processing
- Provide training and technical support
- Empower women and indigenous farmers
- Create sustainable livelihoods

**Multi-Level Structure** (Unique):

**Village Level**:
- Primary groups (60+ villages)
- 30-80 members per group
- Local leadership and coordination
- Quality monitoring
- Training delivery
- Initial collection

**Zone Level**:
- Regional coordination (8 zones)
- Zone managers and warehouses
- Quality control and cupping
- Technical support
- Regional storage

**Central Level**:
- Central administration (Jaén headquarters)
- Export coordination
- Buyer relationships
- Certification management
- Strategic planning
- Finance and accounting
- Quality lab and cupping
- Dry mill and processing

This structure enables 3,200+ farmers across remote communities to function as unified cooperative with quality control and market access.

**Women's Participation**:
- 35% women members (increasing)
- Women's leadership positions (board, committees)
- Women's coffee sub-cooperative (women-only lots)
- Economic empowerment focus
- Family income control shifts toward women

**Philosophy**:
"Café de Paz y Dignidad" (Coffee of Peace and Dignity). Small farmers organized democratically to escape poverty, gain market access, and achieve sustainable livelihoods through specialty coffee. Cooperative empowerment creates economic justice and community development.

2. **Caturra** (30%)
   - Bourbon mutation
   - Higher productivity than Typica
   - Good cup quality
   - Compact plant (easier management)
   - Reliable production

3. **Bourbon** (15%)
   - Heritage variety
   - Excellent cup quality
   - Sweet, balanced profile
   - Some older farms maintain
   - Premium micro-lots
