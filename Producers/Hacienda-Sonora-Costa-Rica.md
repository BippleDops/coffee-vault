   - Delicate, tea-like acidity

2. **Yellow Honey** (25-50% mucilage):
   - Moderate mucilage retention
   - Sun drying (10-12 days)
   - Balanced profile
   - Bright acidity, medium body
   - Honey sweetness emerging

3. **Red Honey** (50-75% mucilage):
   - Significant mucilage retention
   - Shade drying or extended sun drying (12-15 days)
