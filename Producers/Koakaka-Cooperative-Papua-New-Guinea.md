- No quality incentive
- No value addition

**After Cooperative** (2008+):
- Central washing station built
- Members deliver cherries
- Cooperative processes to parchment
- Direct sales to exporters
- Fair pricing, quality premiums

**Processing Methods**:

**Primary Method - Washed Process** (70%):

**Washed Process Protocol**:

1. **Cherry Reception** (Daily during harvest):
   - Farmers deliver cherries (walked from villages, sometimes hours)
   - Reception hours: 8am-6pm
   - Quality inspection (ripe selection)
   - Underripe/overripe rejected or paid lower price
   - Weight recording (farmer payment tracking)

2. **Flotation**:
   - Water flotation tank
   - Floaters removed (defects, underripe)
   - Density sorting
   - Quality control

3. **Pulping** (Same day as delivery):
   - Mechanical disc pulper (hand-crank or small motor)
   - Skin removal, mucilage remains
   - Parchment flows to fermentation tanks

4. **Fermentation** (18-36 hours):
   - Concrete or plastic fermentation tanks
   - Dry fermentation (no water added initially)
   - Cool mountain temperatures = longer fermentation (24-36 hours)
   - Mucilage breakdown
   - Monitoring by smell, touch

5. **Washing**:
   - Clean mountain spring water
   - Multiple rinses
   - Washing channels (gravity-fed)
   - Complete mucilage removal

6. **Drying**:
   - Raised bed drying (African beds)
   - Greenhouse drying tables (rain protection, wet season)
   - 12-18 days (weather-dependent)
   - Turned multiple times daily
   - Moisture monitoring
   - Target: 11-12% moisture

**Semi-Washed Process** (20%):
- Partial fermentation
- Less water use (conservation)
- Faster processing
- Still good quality
- Used when water scarce or efficiency needed

**Natural Process** (10% - Experimental):
- Limited (wet season makes natural processing challenging)
- Dry season only (Oct-Feb)
- Whole cherry drying
- Raised beds only
- 25-35 days
- Experimental lots

**Processing Challenges - Wet Season**:
Harvest coincides with wet season (April-Sept):
