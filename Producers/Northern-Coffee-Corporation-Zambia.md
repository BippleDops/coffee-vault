# Northern Coffee Corporation

## Overview

Northern Coffee Corporation (NCC) represents Zambia's ambitious coffee renaissance, uniting 8,500 smallholder families across 38 cooperatives in Northern Province to produce emerging specialty coffees scoring 82-87 points that showcase Zambia's potential as Africa's next quality origin. Established in 2004 during Zambia's post-colonial coffee revival, NCC has transformed from struggling commodity producers to quality-focused cooperative network achieving Fair Trade (2006) and organic certification (2008), pioneering traceability, and building direct trade relationships that demonstrate African coffee's untapped potential beyond traditional powerhouses Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda.

Zambia's coffee history mirrors broader African patterns: colonial-era introduction (1950s, Northern Rhodesia), estate dominance, post-independence decline (1970s-90s), and recent smallholder-driven revival. Unlike neighbors with established reputations (Tanzania, Malawi), Zambian coffee remains relatively unknown—a disadvantage in recognition but an advantage as "undiscovered origin" for specialty roasters seeking differentiation. NCC coffees—bright, citrus-forward, stone fruit complexity, clean—rival established East African profiles at more accessible pricing, offering exceptional value proposition for quality-focused buyers.

Beyond coffee quality, NCC exemplifies post-colonial cooperative development and women's empowerment: 48% women members (near gender parity), Fair Trade premiums building schools and health clinics serving 35,000+ people, HIV/AIDS support programs critical in high-prevalence region, and organic agriculture protecting Zambia's forests and watersheds. The cooperative's name reflects both geography (Northern Province) and corporate structure (federation of cooperatives), embodying collective action's power to transform smallholder agriculture in challenging contexts.

## Location and Geography

### Regional Context

**Northern Province**: Remote northern Zambia, bordering Tanzania and DR Congo, highlands and plateau region

**Primary Growing Areas**: Kasama and Mbala districts (historical coffee zones), Mungwi and Isoka (expanding areas)

**Altitude**: 1,200-1,800 meters above sea level
- Moderate-high altitude provides quality potential
- Cooler temperatures at elevation
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (12-15°C)
- Lower than top East African origins (Kenya, Ethiopia 1,800-2,300m) but competitive

**Microclimate**: Tropical highland with distinct wet and dry seasons
- April-September: Dry season, primary harvest period (cool, 15-22°C)
- October-December: Early rains, flowering period
- January-March: Main rainy season (warm, humid, 22-28°C)
- Annual rainfall: 1,000-1,400mm (adequate, consistent)
