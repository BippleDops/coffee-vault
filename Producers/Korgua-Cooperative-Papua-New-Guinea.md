# Korgua Cooperative

## Overview

Korgua Cooperative stands as one of Papua New Guinea's premier coffee cooperatives, representing 2,800 smallholder families across the rugged Eastern Highlands Province. Established in 1997 during PNG's post-independence agricultural development era, Korgua has evolved from a basic collection point to a sophisticated quality-focused organization producing specialty-grade coffees that consistently score 84-89 points and compete in international markets.

Papua New Guinea's coffee has a legendary reputation among specialty coffee enthusiasts, known for its complex, exotic profile combining fruit, floral, chocolate, and earthy notes that reflect the island's incredible biodiversity. Korgua exemplifies the best of PNG coffee: ultra-high altitude cultivation (1,500-1,900 MASL), traditional shade-grown agroforestry, meticulous washed processing, and the unique terroir of volcanic soils and pristine mountain ecosystems.

Beyond coffee quality, Korgua represents a model of indigenous community development, women's empowerment, and environmental stewardship. The cooperative has invested heavily in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, transforming member communities and creating economic opportunity in one of the world's most remote and challenging agricultural regions.
