## 🔬 Processing - Double Fermentation Excellence

Gichataini is renowned for meticulous double fermentation washed processing, producing exceptionally clean, complex Kenyan coffee.

**Kenyan Washed Process** (Traditional Double Fermentation):

**Full Processing Protocol**:

**Day 1 - Cherry Reception & Pulping**:
1. **Reception** (Same-day delivery required):
   - Farmers deliver cherries same day as picking
   - Reception hours: 2pm-7pm
   - Cherry quality inspection
   - Underripe/overripe cherries rejected
   - Weight recording (farmer payment tracking)

2. **Flotation**:
   - Water flotation tank
   - Floaters removed (underripe, defects)
   - Density sorting
   - First quality checkpoint

3. **Pulping** (Evening, within hours of harvest):
   - Mechanical disc pulper
   - Skin removal, mucilage remains
   - Parchment separation by density (gravity channels)
   - P1 (highest density), P2, P3 grades separated

**Day 2 - First Fermentation**:
4. **Dry Fermentation** (12-24 hours):
   - Parchment in tiled tanks
   - No water added (dry fermentation)
   - Mucilage breaks down naturally
   - Fermentation time: Temperature-dependent (16-24 hours)
   - Cool nights (common at 1,800m) = longer fermentation
   - Monitoring by touch, smell, visual inspection

**Day 3 - First Washing & Second Fermentation**:
5. **First Washing**:
   - Clean water washing
   - Mucilage removal
   - Multiple rinses
   - Washing channels with agitation

6. **Soaking** (Second Fermentation):
   - 12-24 hours soaking in clean water
   - Parchment fully submerged
   - Further flavor development
   - Cleanliness enhancement
   - This second fermentation is Kenya's signature

**Day 4 - Final Washing & Drying Begins**:
7. **Final Washing**:
   - Multiple rinses in clean water
   - Complete cleanliness
   - Final quality inspection
   - Removal of any remaining mucilage

8. **Drying Initiation**:
   - Transfer to raised drying tables
   - African raised beds (mesh)
   - Initial moisture reduction

**Days 4-18 - Drying**:
9. **Raised Bed Drying** (12-18 days):
   - African raised beds (mesh, airflow from below)
   - Thin layers (2-3cm depth)
   - Hand-sorting during drying (defect removal)
   - Turned every 1-2 hours during peak sun
   - Covered during hottest hours (prevent cracking)
   - Covered at night (dew protection)
   - Slow, controlled drying

10. **Moisture Monitoring**:
    - Multiple daily moisture checks
    - Target: 10-11% moisture
    - Even drying crucial for quality

11. **Hand-Sorting**:
    - During drying: Defect removal
    - Multiple passes
    - Visual inspection
    - Quality obsession

**Post-Drying**:
12. **Resting**:
    - Parchment rested 30-60 days
    - Moisture stabilization
    - Flavor maturation
    - Storage in parchment protects green coffee

13. **Delivery to Cooperative**:
    - Parchment delivered to Barichu Cooperative
    - Cooperative arranges dry-milling
    - Final grading (AA, AB, C, etc.)
    - Auction or direct sale

**Why Double Fermentation Works**:
- First fermentation: Mucilage breakdown
- Second fermentation (soaking): Flavor complexity, cleanliness
- Result: Exceptionally clean, bright, complex Kenyan coffee
- This method is labor and time-intensive but produces Kenya's signature quality

**Processing Infrastructure**:

- **Pulper**: Mechanical disc pulper (high-quality)
- **Fermentation Tanks**: Tiled tanks (temperature stable, clean)
- **Washing Channels**: Multiple-stage washing system

**Quality Control**:
- Cherry reception quality checks
- Flotation density sorting
- Fermentation monitoring (smell, touch, timing)
- Drying moisture checks (multiple daily)
- Hand-sorting during drying
- Pre-delivery cupping (sample lots)
- Traceability (lots tracked by date, grade)

**Water Management**:
- Clean water essential (Kenya's signature brightness)
- Water sourced from Mount Kenya runoff
- Water recycling where possible
- Pulp composting (not water discharge)
- Environmental consciousness

**Lot Separation**:
- By day (daily lots)
- By grade (P1, P2, P3 from pulping)
