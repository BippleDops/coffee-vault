## ☕ Varieties Cultivated (By Members)

**Primary Varieties**:

1. **Timor Hybrid** (50% of collective)
   - Arabica-Robusta hybrid (Timor IHCAFE90)
   - Developed in Timor, adapted to Indonesia
   - Disease resistant (especially coffee leaf rust)
   - Good cup quality despite hybrid genetics
   - Productive and reliable
   - Adapted to Gayo conditions

2. **Ateng** (30%)
   - Local name for Catimor varieties
   - Compact plant, high productivity
   - Rust resistant
   - Decent cup quality
   - Quick maturation
   - Popular among smallholders

3. **Catimor Selections** (15%)
   - Various Catimor cultivars
   - Bred for disease resistance and productivity
   - Adequate cup quality
   - Consistent production
   - Reliable income source

4. **Typica Heritage** (5%)
   - Traditional variety (increasingly rare)
   - Some older farms maintain
   - Lower productivity
   - Exceptional cup quality when found
   - Heritage preservation

**Varietal Reality**:
Unlike origins with heritage varieties (Ethiopia, Panama, Yemen), Indonesia's varieties are primarily hybrids and Catimors - chosen for disease resistance and productivity over cup quality. However, Sumatra's unique wet-hulled processing and terroir create distinctive profile regardless of variety.

**Rust Resistance Focus**:
Coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) is major threat in humid Indonesia. Farmers prioritize rust-resistant varieties (Timor, Ateng, Catimor) for survival and economic viability. The trade-off (yield/disease resistance vs cup complexity) is necessary in this environment.

**Variety Management**:
- Cooperative provides seedlings (improved varieties)
- Education on varietal characteristics
- Replanting programs (old trees → rust-resistant varieties)
- Lot separation by variety when possible
- Quality feedback to guide variety selection

## 🔬 Processing Methods (Wet-Hulled / Giling Basah)

**Wet-Hulled Processing** (Giling Basah) - 90% of production

Wet-hulled processing is unique to Indonesia and defines Sumatran coffee's distinctive character.

**Why Wet-Hulled?**:
- **Climate**: High humidity makes traditional drying difficult
- **Economics**: Faster process (farmers receive payment sooner)
- **Tradition**: Centuries-old Indonesian method
- **Infrastructure**: Limited drying space on small farms
- **Market**: Creates distinctive Sumatran profile

**Wet-Hulled Process Steps**:

**At Farm Level** (Member Farmers):

1. **Harvest & Floatation**:
   - Selective hand-picking (ripe cherry)
   - Floatation in buckets (remove underripes)
   - Same-day processing

2. **Depulping**:
   - Small hand-crank or mechanical pulpers at home
   - Skin removed, mucilage retained
   - Parchment coffee (kopi gabah)

3. **Brief Fermentation** (6-12 hours):
   - Short fermentation overnight
   - Mucilage partially broken down
   - Washed in morning

4. **Partial Drying** (1-2 days):
   - Parchment dried on tarps/patios
   - Target: 40-50% moisture (still very wet)
   - NOT fully dried (key difference from washed process)

5. **Delivery to Cooperative**:
   - Wet parchment sold to cooperative
   - Farmers receive payment (crucial cashflow)
   - Moisture content: 40-50%

**At Cooperative Level**:

6. **Wet Hulling**:
   - Parchment removed while coffee still wet (40-50% moisture)
   - Exposes green bean to air while wet
   - Creates distinctive blue-green color
   - Bean swells and softens

7. **Final Drying** (5-7 days):
   - Green coffee dried on large patios
   - Target: 12-13% moisture
   - Hand-sorted during drying
   - Covered at night (humidity protection)

8. **Dry Milling & Sorting**:
   - Screen sizing
   - Density sorting
   - Defect removal
   - Hand-sorting (final quality check)
   - Grading (Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.)

**Wet-Hulled Process Effects**:
- **Body**: Creates Sumatra's signature full, heavy body
- **Earthy/Herbal**: Distinctive earthy, herbal, cedary notes
- **Low Acidity**: Muted acidity, smooth
- **Savory/Complex**: Umami, tobacco, earth, spice
- **Color**: Blue-green bean appearance
- **Consistency**: More variable than washed (nature of process)

**Quality Challenges & Management**:
Wet-hulling creates quality risks:
- Mold potential (wet conditions)
- Inconsistent drying
- Defects more likely
- Variable quality

Cooperative's quality control:
- Moisture monitoring
- Defect removal (multiple stages)
- Lot separation
- Storage management
- Cupping and grading

**Alternative Processing** (10% - Recent Innovation):

**Washed Process**:
- Some members experiment with full washed
- Longer drying (10-14 days to 10-11% moisture)
- Hulled when dry (like typical washed coffee)
- Creates cleaner, brighter profile (different from typical Sumatra)
- Premium pricing for specialty roasters

**Natural Process**:
- Limited experimental lots
- Whole cherry drying
- Challenging in humid climate
- Rare but increasing
