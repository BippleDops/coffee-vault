## 🏛️ Organization Structure

**Organization Type**: Independent Family Farm
**Established**: 1952 (70+ years)
**Current Generation**: Third generation García family
**Management**: Owner-operated, woman-led (Elena García)
**Workers**: 4 permanent employees + 20-30 seasonal pickers

**Mexican Coffee Context**:
Mexico is major coffee producer (world's top 10), but unlike industrialized Brazil or estate-dominated Central America, Mexico is smallholder country. Chiapas state (southernmost, bordering Guatemala) produces Mexico's premier coffee - high altitude, shade-grown, organic tradition, indigenous farming heritage. Mexican coffee has historically been undervalued despite quality, but specialty market increasingly recognizes value.

**Chiapas & Soconusco Region**:
Soconusco region (Pacific slope of Chiapas) is Mexico's coffee heartland:
- High altitude (1,200-1,800m)
- Volcanic soil from Tacaná volcano
- Cloud forest microclimate
- Shade-grown tradition (indigenous heritage)
- Organic by practice (limited chemical use)
- Bird migration corridor (ecological importance)
- Fair Trade and Organic cooperative leadership

**Family Farm History**:
Finca Terrazas del Bosque ("Forest Terraces Farm") established 1952 by García family:
- **1st Generation** (1952-1980s): Farm established, traditional cultivation
- **2nd Generation** (1980s-2010s): Expansion, organic transition, Fair Trade
- **3rd Generation** (2010s-Present): Elena García leadership, specialty focus, women's empowerment, bird-friendly certification

**Women's Leadership**:
Elena García represents emerging women's coffee leadership:
- Inherited farm management from father (2015)
- First woman manager in family history
- Advocates for women in coffee
- Quality focus and specialty market relationships
- Environmental stewardship and bird conservation

**Philosophy**:
"Café con Conciencia" (Coffee with Consciousness). Traditional shade-grown cultivation that preserves cloud forest, protects migratory birds, supports biodiversity, while producing exceptional coffee and providing family livelihood. Coffee farming as environmental stewardship, not just agriculture.

## 🌿 Farm Characteristics

**Altitude Range**: 1,300-1,600 meters above sea level
**Typical Altitude**: 1,450 meters
**Total Farm Size**: 28 hectares (69 acres)
**Coffee Productive Area**: 24 hectares
**Forest Reserve**: 4 hectares cloud forest preserved
**Terrain**: Mountain slopes, terraced (hence farm name)
**Soil Type**: Volcanic, clay-loam, mineral-rich
**Microclimate**: Cloud forest - high humidity, abundant rainfall

**Soconusco Terroir Advantages**:
1. **Volcanic Soil**: Tacaná volcano provides mineral-rich soil
2. **High Altitude**: 1,300-1,600m produces dense beans, complex flavor
3. **Cloud Forest**: Natural shade, humidity regulation, biodiversity
4. **Rainfall**: Abundant moisture (2,000-3,000mm annually)
5. **Microclimate**: Cool nights, fog, ideal for slow ripening

- Multi-story canopy (forest structure)
- Wildlife corridors maintained
- Zero deforestation commitment

This creates true shade-grown coffee - not just shade tree, but intact forest ecosystem.

**Bird-Friendly Habitat**:
Chiapas is crucial corridor for migratory birds (North America ↔ South America):
- Over 200 bird species use farm's shade canopy
- Migratory warblers, tanagers, orioles winter in coffee forest
- Resident tropical species year-round
- Provides critical habitat in increasingly deforested landscape
- Smithsonian Bird-Friendly certification recognizes habitat quality

**Farm Layout**:

## 🔬 Processing Methods (Traditional + Innovation)

**On-Farm Processing**:

Small wet mill enables processing control:

**1. Washed Process** (70% of production)

**Traditional Mexican Washed**:

1. **Selective Harvest**:
   - Hand-picking, multiple passes
   - Only fully ripe cherry
   - Family members inspect picking quality
   - Same-day processing (within 6 hours)

2. **Floatation & Sorting**:
   - Cherry floated in tanks
   - Remove underripes, floaters, defects
   - Visual hand-sorting

3. **Depulping**:
   - Small mechanical depulper
   - Skin removed, mucilage retained
   - Parchment coffee

4. **Fermentation** (18-30 hours):
   - Concrete fermentation tanks
   - Natural enzymatic breakdown
   - Cool highland/cloud forest temperature = longer fermentation
   - Monitored by touch, smell, pH testing

5. **Washing**:
   - Spring water (mountain source)
   - Multiple wash cycles
   - Washing channels
   - Final rinse until completely clean

6. **Drying** (12-18 days):
   - Raised African beds (mesh, airflow)
   - Some patio drying (concrete)
   - Thin layers, regular turning
   - Hand-sorted during drying
   - Covered at night (humidity, dew protection)
   - Careful moisture management (cloud forest humidity challenges)
   - Target moisture: 10-11%

7. **Resting**:
   - 30-60 days in parchment
   - Flavor development
   - Storage in dry area

**2. Natural Process** (20% - Growing Specialty)

Recent natural processing for specialty market:

1. **Cherry Selection**:
   - Only fully ripe, perfect cherry
   - More selective than washed
   - Floatation and hand-sorting

2. **Drying** (20-30 days):
   - Raised beds (essential in humid climate)
   - Whole cherry drying
   - Thin layers (single cherry layer)
   - Turned frequently (prevent mold in humidity)
   - Covered during rain (frequent in cloud forest)
   - Slow, careful drying
   - Challenging in humid climate but rewarding

3. **Resting**:
   - Extended rest (60-90 days in cherry)
   - Flavor development

**3. Honey Process** (10% - Experimental)

Limited honey processing experiments:
- Yellow honey (light mucilage)
- Red honey (substantial mucilage)
- Challenging in humid climate (mold risk)
- Careful monitoring required
- Specialty roaster interest
- Premium pricing potential

**Quality Control**:
- Cherry sorting (floatation, visual)
- Fermentation monitoring (timing, pH)
- Drying moisture checks (daily, handheld meter)
- Hand-sorting during drying (continuous defect removal)
- Lot separation (variety, ripeness, process)
- Cupping evaluation (quality verification)

**Processing Challenges**:
Cloud forest humidity creates processing difficulty:
- Longer drying times (18+ days vs 10-12 in dry climates)
- Mold risk (natural process especially challenging)
- Careful monitoring essential
- Infrastructure investment (covered drying, raised beds)
- Experience and knowledge critical
