# Doi Chaang Coffee Cooperative - Thailand

## Overview

Doi Chaang Coffee Cooperative represents one of Southeast Asia's most remarkable coffee success stories—a tribal Akha hill tribe cooperative in Thailand's northern mountains that transformed from opium poppy cultivation and extreme poverty to producing award-winning specialty coffee scoring 84-90 points and establishing its own international brand. Founded in 2003 in Doi Chaang village (1,200-1,650 MASL) near the Myanmar border in Chiang Rai Province, the cooperative brings together approximately 420 Akha and Lisu tribal families who cultivate organic coffee on steep forested slopes that once grew opium poppies for the heroin trade. Over 20 years, Doi Chaang has become internationally recognized—winning specialty coffee competitions, establishing direct trade partnerships with roasters worldwide, creating its own roasting company and cafe chain in Canada, and pioneering Thai specialty coffee in global markets.

The cooperative's story is inseparable from Thailand's Royal Project—King Bhumibol Adulyadej's (Rama IX) multi-decade initiative to provide hill tribes with sustainable crop alternatives to opium cultivation. Beginning in the 1970s, the Royal Project introduced coffee, tea, and vegetables to northern hill tribes, providing agricultural training, infrastructure, and market access to replace opium as income source. Doi Chaang village participated in Royal Project coffee programs from the 1980s, but production remained small-scale, low-quality, and sold to intermediaries at minimal prices until 2003 when villagers organized the cooperative with support from a Canadian social enterprise partner (Doi Chaang Coffee Company) committed to direct trade, quality improvement, and community development.

Today, Doi Chaang Cooperative members cultivate Catimor, Caturra, Typica, and SL28 varieties at 1,200-1,650 meters using predominantly organic methods, producing 280-380 tons annually of washed, natural, honey, and experimentally processed coffees. The cooperative operates its own wet processing facility, dry mill, quality control lab with professional cupping equipment, and has trained Akha members as Q-graders (certified coffee tasters) and baristas. Doi Chaang coffee is sold globally—including through the cooperative's own Canadian roasting company and 20+ cafes—creating an unprecedented model of producer-owned vertical integration from farm to cup. The cooperative's success has transformed Doi Chaang village from a poor opium-growing community to a relatively prosperous coffee town with improved infrastructure, education, healthcare, and the pride of seeing "Doi Chaang" recognized internationally as a premium Thai coffee brand.

## Location and Geography

### Northern Thailand Highlands, Chiang Rai Province

Chiang Rai Province occupies Thailand's northernmost reaches, bordering Myanmar (west/north) and Laos (east) in the Golden Triangle region historically notorious for opium production. The province is mountainous, forested, and culturally distinct from lowland Thailand—home to numerous hill tribe ethnic minorities (Akha, Lisu, Hmong, Karen, Lahu, and others) who migrated from southern China, Myanmar, and Laos over past 150-200 years.

**Doi Chaang Village Location**:
- **Mountain**: Doi Chaang (meaning "Elephant Mountain" in northern Thai dialect) rises to 1,650 meters
- **Elevation**: Village center at ~1,200m, coffee farms 1,200-1,650m
- **Position**: Near Myanmar border (15-20 km east), in Wiang Kaen District, Chiang Rai Province
- **Distance from Chiang Rai city**: 80 km northwest (2.5-3 hours on mountain roads)
- **Distance from Bangkok**: 900 km north (12-14 hours drive or 1.5 hour flight to Chiang Rai + 3 hour drive)

**Topography**:
- **Slopes**: Steep mountainsides (30-60% gradients), coffee planted on forested slopes
- **Forest**: Surrounded by montane tropical forest (mix of evergreen and deciduous species)
- **Watersheds**: Multiple streams draining Doi Chaang mountain, feeding Mekong River system
- **Accessibility**: Paved road to village (improved from dirt road 15 years ago), but many farms accessible only by foot or motorbike trails

**Climate**:
Northern Thailand has tropical monsoon climate modified by altitude:

- **Hot season**: March-May, temperatures 25-35°C (77-95°F) at village elevation
- **Rainy season**: May-October (southwest monsoon), 1,200-1,800mm annual rainfall
- **Cool/dry season**: November-February, temperatures 10-25°C (50-77°F), harvest season
- **Frost**: Rare but possible at highest elevations during coldest nights (December-January)
- **Humidity**: High during rainy season (80-95%), lower during cool/dry season (50-70%)
- **Mist**: Frequent morning fog and cloud cover, especially during rainy season and cool season

**Soil**:
- **Type**: Weathered mountain soils, acidic, derived from granite and sandstone parent material
- **Color**: Red-brown to orange (iron-rich from weathering in tropical climate)
- **Texture**: Clay-loam, well-structured in forested areas
- **Fertility**: Moderate natural fertility, requires management in cultivated areas
- **Drainage**: Excellent on slopes (critical for coffee quality)
- **pH**: Acidic (4.5-5.5), appropriate for coffee
- **Organic matter**: High in forested areas (leaf litter), must be maintained in coffee farms through composting, mulching

**Ecosystem**:
- **Forest type**: Montane tropical forest transitioning to evergreen forest at higher elevations
- **Biodiversity**: Moderate—elephants (occasional visits, hence mountain's name), wild boar, civets, various bird species
- **Deforestation pressure**: Historical opium cultivation cleared forests; coffee cultivation maintains some forest cover through shade systems
- **Protected areas**: Nearby national parks (Doi Luang, Lam Nam Kok) provide conservation framework

### Golden Triangle and Opium Legacy

**Historical Context**:
The "Golden Triangle"—mountainous region where Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos borders meet—was historically one of world's largest opium-producing regions:

- **19th-20th century**: Hill tribes (especially Hmong, Akha, Lisu) cultivated opium poppies as cash crop
- **Opium trade**: Controlled by various armed groups, warlords (Kuomintang remnants, ethnic militias)
- **1960s-1990s**: Peak production—Golden Triangle supplied majority of world's heroin
- **Hill tribe economy**: Opium was primary cash crop for impoverished hill tribes (food crops couldn't generate income, opium could be transported from remote mountains)

**Thai Government Response**:
- **1970s**: King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Royal Project initiated to provide opium alternatives
- **Crop substitution**: Coffee, tea, temperate vegetables, fruit trees promoted as alternative cash crops
- **Infrastructure**: Roads, irrigation, processing facilities, market access provided to hill tribe communities
- **Education and healthcare**: Schools, clinics built to improve hill tribe welfare
- **By 2000**: Opium cultivation largely eliminated in Thailand (though continues in Myanmar, Laos)

Doi Chaang village was deeply involved in opium cultivation until the 1990s-2000s transition to coffee—making the cooperative's success a powerful example of sustainable crop substitution.

## Historical Context

### Akha Hill Tribe Heritage

**Akha People**:
The Akha are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic minority originally from Yunnan Province, southern China, who migrated to Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam over past 150-200 years, fleeing conflict, land pressure, and seeking new agricultural land.

**Cultural Characteristics**:
- **Language**: Akha language (Tibeto-Burman family), distinct from Thai, unwritten until recent decades
- **Religion**: Traditional animist beliefs (ancestor worship, spirit rituals), some Christian conversion (missionaries active in hill tribes)
- **Social structure**: Patrilineal clans, village leadership by elders, strong community cohesion
- **Traditional dress**: Distinctive elaborate headdresses, silver ornaments, colorful clothing (women's traditional dress)
- **Livelihoods**: Historically swidden agriculture (slash-and-burn rotating cultivation), opium cultivation, subsistence rice, corn
- **Marginalization**: Akha and other hill tribes historically marginalized in Thailand—lacking citizenship, land rights, access to education/healthcare

**Doi Chaang Village**:
- Founded 1960s-1970s by Akha families migrating from Myanmar
- Population: ~2,500-3,000 people (420 families in cooperative, ~800 total village families)
- Primarily Akha ethnicity with some Lisu families
- Village maintained traditional Akha culture, language, ceremonies despite modernization pressures

### Coffee Introduction and Cooperative Formation

**Royal Project Era (1980s-1990s)**:
- **1983**: Royal Project introduced coffee seedlings (Catimor, Caturra) to Doi Chaang village as opium alternative
- **Training**: Royal Project agronomists taught coffee cultivation, processing basics
- **1980s-1990s**: Villagers planted coffee but production small-scale, quality poor, no direct market access
- **Intermediaries**: Farmers sold cherry or low-grade green beans to traders at minimal prices ($0.20-0.50/lb)
- **Continued poverty**: Coffee income insufficient, some families continued opium cultivation secretly

**Crisis and Opportunity (late 1990s-early 2000s)**:
- **Opium eradication intensified**: Thai government/military crackdowns on remaining opium cultivation
- **Coffee prices collapsed**: Global coffee crisis (2000-2003) drove prices below production costs
- **Extreme poverty**: Doi Chaang villagers caught between opium eradication and coffee income crisis
- **2001**: Akha village leaders sought solutions—how to make coffee economically viable?

**Wicha Promyong and Canadian Partnership (2003)**:
In 2003, Wicha Promyong, an Akha villager from Doi Chaang educated in Canada, returned to village and partnered with Canadian social entrepreneur John M. Darch to form transformative partnership:

**Doi Chaang Coffee Cooperative** (cooperative formed 2003):

Specialty buyers excited by novelty, quality (88-90 points), and story of Kenyan variety thriving in Thai highlands.

## Coffee Processing

### Washed Processing (Primary Method)

Approximately 75-80% of Doi Chaang coffee is fully washed, producing clean, bright, fruit-forward profiles.

**Harvest**:
- **Season**: November-March (peak December-February)
- **Selective picking**: Ripe red cherries only, 3-5 passes through farms
- **Training**: Cooperative extensively trains pickers on cherry selection (quality directly affects price)
- **Same-day delivery**: Farmers transport cherries to cooperative wet mill within hours of picking

**Wet Processing at Cooperative Facility**:

1. **Cherry Reception and Sorting**:
   - Visual inspection by cooperative staff, defect removal
   - Flotation in water tanks: floaters (underripe, dried, defects) removed, sinkers (quality cherries) continue
   - Cherries weighed, farmers credited

2. **Pulping**:
   - Mechanical disc pulpers remove skin, most fruit pulp
   - Careful calibration to avoid damaging beans
   - Pulp collected for composting, returned to members as fertilizer

3. **Fermentation**:
   - Mucilage-covered beans fermented in concrete tanks 12-24 hours
   - Fermentation time varies by temperature (shorter during warm months, longer during cool season)
   - Natural fermentation (ambient microbes) breaks down sticky mucilage
   - Staff monitor fermentation progress (rubbing beans, checking mucilage breakdown)
   - Careful timing prevents over-fermentation (sour defects)

4. **Washing**:
   - Fermented beans washed in channels with clean flowing water
   - Agitation removes loosened mucilage
   - Multiple rinses until water clear
   - Density sorting during washing (floaters removed)

5. **Drying**:
   - Washed parchment spread on raised beds or greenhouse dryers
   - Thin layers (2-3 cm) for even airflow, consistent drying
   - 10-16 days to 10.5-11.5% moisture content
   - Turned every 2-3 hours when sun-drying
   - Covered or moved to greenhouse during rain (Thailand's dry season generally favorable but occasional storms)
   - Moisture content carefully monitored (meters)

6. **Dry Parchment Rest**:
   - Rested 30-60 days to stabilize moisture, mellow flavors

**Quality Control**:
- **Hulling**: Parchment mechanically removed at cooperative dry mill
- **Grading**: Screen sorted by size, density sorted (gravity tables)
- **Electronic sorting**: Color sorters remove defects
- **Hand-sorting**: Final defect removal by trained workers (mostly women from cooperative families)
- **Cupping**: Q-graders cup all export lots, identify micro-lots, verify no defects

### Natural and Honey Processing

Since 2010, Doi Chaang has experimented with natural and honey processing (20-25% of production currently):

**Natural Processing**:
- Whole cherries dried intact on raised beds
- 20-30 day drying with frequent turning
- Requires careful monitoring (mold risk during humid periods)
- Produces fruit-forward, heavier body, berry-winey profile (85-89 points when successful)
- Thailand's relatively dry cool season (November-February) enables natural processing
- Growing market demand, profitable specialty niche

**Honey Processing**:
- Pulped cherries dried with mucilage partially (yellow honey) or fully (red honey) intact
- 12-18 day drying with frequent turning
- Intermediate profile: more body/fruit than washed, cleaner than natural (85-88 points)
- Less risky than full natural (faster drying, less fermentation risk)

**Anaerobic and Experimental Fermentation** (since 2015):

Doi Chaang has pioneered experimental fermentation in Thailand:

1. **Anaerobic Fermentation**:
   - Whole cherries or pulped beans fermented in sealed containers (limiting oxygen)
   - 24-72 hour fermentation, controlled temperature
   - Creates intense fruit, floral, winey complexity
   - 87-90 points when successful, high defect risk

2. **Carbonic Maceration**:
   - Whole cherries in CO2 environment (inspired by wine production)
   - 3-7 days in sealed tanks
   - Creates unique tropical fruit, bubble gum, floral notes
   - 86-90 points, highly distinctive

3. **Koji Fermentation** (experimental):
   - Using koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae, used in sake, miso production) to ferment coffee
   - Collaboration with Japanese buyers, research institutions
   - Creates umami, savory-sweet, unusual complexity
   - Very limited experimental lots (88-90 points)

**Processing Innovation Strategy**:
- Position Doi Chaang as Thailand's processing innovation leader
- Differentiate from commodity Robusta (Thailand primarily Robusta producer—Arabica less than 1% of national production)
- Attract specialty buyers seeking unique profiles, experimental coffees
- Create premium micro-lots commanding $5-10/lb (vs $2.50-3.50 standard washed)

- Cooperative meetings, training conducted in Akha language
- Countering language loss as youth adopt Thai language

**Traditional Culture**:
- Cooperative supports traditional Akha ceremonies, festivals (New Year ceremonies, ancestor worship)
- Akha traditional dress, customs maintained (younger generation increasingly proud of heritage due to coffee success)
- Cultural museum in village showcasing Akha history, crafts, traditions (tourism)

**Identity and Empowerment**:
- Akha villagers previously marginalized now seen as successful entrepreneurs
- Cooperative demonstrates Akha community can succeed, contributing to Thai economy
- Shift from stigma (opium, poverty) to pride (specialty coffee, international brand)

### Women's Empowerment

**Challenges**:
- Traditional Akha patriarchal structures (men control land, major decisions)
- Women's labor central to harvest, processing but historically underrecognized, undercompensated

**Cooperative Initiatives**:

1. **Economic Participation**:
   - 30% women members or women-headed households
   - Women employed in processing (quality sorting, cupping)
   - Equal pay for equal work policies

2. **Leadership**:
   - Women on cooperative board (currently 3 of 9 members)
   - Women's committee addressing specific concerns
   - Leadership training for women

3. **Capacity Building**:
   - Barista training for young women (employment in cafes, specialty coffee shops)
   - Q-grader training (one woman from cooperative is certified Q-grader)
   - Microfinance savings groups

**Progress**:
- Women's economic agency increasing
- Cultural norms slowly shifting (still significant work needed)
- Young women returning to village for coffee careers (previously almost all migrated to cities)

### Youth Engagement and Education

**Education Investments**:
- **Scholarships**: 150+ annual scholarships (secondary school, vocational school, university)
- **School improvements**: Computer lab, English language programs, science equipment
- **Results**: Village high school graduation rate increased from 30% to 85%+, 20+ village youth attended university (previously zero)

**Youth Coffee Careers**:

- **Q-grader certification**: Young members trained as certified coffee cuppers
- **Agronomy**: Some youth studying agriculture, returning to manage family farms or work for cooperative
- **Cooperative employment**: Youth in quality control, administration, marketing roles

**Retention**:
- Growing number of educated youth returning to Doi Chaang (attracted by coffee income, pride in brand, connection to community)
- 15-20% of cooperative members under 35 (increasing from <5% before cooperative)

### Tourism and Community Development

**Coffee Tourism**:
- Doi Chaang village increasingly popular tourist destination (domestic Thai tourists, international coffee enthusiasts)
- Farm tours, processing demonstrations, cupping classes, cultural experiences (Akha traditional dress, ceremonies, crafts)
- Tourism income supplements coffee (homestays, restaurants, crafts sales)
- Risk: Over-tourism, cultural commodification—cooperative working to manage sustainably

## Environmental Sustainability

### Organic Shade-Grown Coffee

**Environmental Benefits**:
- **No chemicals**: Protecting water, soil, biodiversity from pesticide/herbicide contamination
- **Shade systems**: 30-60% shade from native trees, fruit trees maintaining forest structure
- **Biodiversity**: Shade coffee provides habitat for birds, insects, small mammals
- **Forest connectivity**: Coffee farms create corridors between forest fragments in mountainous landscape
- **Carbon sequestration**: Trees, organic soil sequester carbon (estimated 60-100 tons CO2/hectare)

**Wildlife**:
- Occasional elephants visiting village (hence "Elephant Mountain" name)
- Wild boar, civets, various bird species
- Shade coffee less disruptive to wildlife than full-sun monoculture

### From Opium to Coffee: Environmental Transformation

**Opium Cultivation Impacts**:
- Slash-and-burn clearing of forests for opium fields
- Steep slope cultivation causing severe erosion
- Short-term land use, constant forest clearing
- Chemical contamination (opium processing chemicals, herbicides)

**Coffee Cultivation Improvements**:
- Permanent perennial crop (coffee trees produce 20-40 years, reducing need for new land clearing)
- Shade systems maintaining tree cover, preventing erosion
- Organic farming eliminating chemical use
- Soil building through composting, mulching

**Net Environmental Impact**:
Coffee transition dramatically improved environmental sustainability compared to opium era—reducing deforestation, erosion, chemical contamination while maintaining economic viability for hill tribes.

### Climate Change Adaptation

**Observed Impacts**:
- Temperature increase (~1.0°C over 30 years)
- Rainfall variability (irregular onset of rainy season, mid-season dry spells)
- More intense storms during rainy season
- Coffee berry borer pressure increasing

**Adaptation Strategies**:
- **Variety selection**: Maintaining rust-resistant Catimor, experimenting with heat-tolerant varieties
- **Shade management**: Increasing shade to buffer temperature extremes
- **Water management**: Some farmers installing drip irrigation for dry season
- **Diversification**: Fruit trees, tea providing income insurance
- **Processing flexibility**: Natural/honey processing when washed processing challenged by water availability
