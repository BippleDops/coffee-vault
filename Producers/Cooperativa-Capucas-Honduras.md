# Cooperativa Capucas (COCAFCAL)

## Overview

Cooperativa Capucas (COCAFCAL—Cooperativa Cafetalera de Capucas Limitada) stands as one of Honduras's most progressive and quality-focused coffee cooperatives—a democratic organization of 550 smallholder families in the La Paz department (1,200-1,700 MASL) producing 400-700 tons annually of specialty coffees scoring 84-91 points, distinguished by pioneering women's leadership, direct trade partnerships, comprehensive Fair Trade and Organic certification, and multiple Cup of Excellence wins. Established in 1999 in the mountain village of Capucas (near Marcala, Honduras's premier coffee region), the cooperative has transformed smallholder livelihoods through quality focus, market access, and social investment, becoming a model for cooperative governance, women's empowerment, and sustainable coffee production in Central America.

Capucas's most remarkable characteristic is women's leadership: the cooperative has been led by women presidents for over a decade (including long-time president Olga Marina Rodriguez, who served 10+ years), 60% of members are women, and the cooperative prioritizes women's empowerment through training, leadership development, and economic independence programs. This women-majority and women-led structure is highly unusual in Latin American coffee (where male dominance is norm), demonstrating that women's leadership enhances quality, transparency, and community development. Under women's leadership, Capucas achieved Fair Trade certification (2000), Organic certification (2002), multiple Cup of Excellence awards, and built extensive direct trade relationships with specialty roasters who value the cooperative's social mission and exceptional coffee quality.

Beyond social impact, Capucas exemplifies quality-driven cooperative development: the cooperative operates centralized wet mills and cupping labs, trains members in selective harvesting and quality processing, separates micro-lots by variety and farm, and markets coffees to specialty and Fair Trade channels. Fair Trade and Organic premiums (combined ~$0.50/lb above commodity prices) are democratically invested in education (schools, scholarships), healthcare (clinics, medical supplies), infrastructure (roads, clean water), and quality improvement (processing equipment, training). This virtuous cycle—quality focus generates premiums, premiums fund development and quality improvement—has lifted member families from subsistence farming to stable middle-class livelihoods, inspiring dozens of other Honduran cooperatives to follow Capucas's model.

## Location and Geography

### La Paz Department: Honduras's Coffee Heartland

**La Paz**: Department in southwestern Honduras, mountainous terrain, traditional coffee-growing region

**Marcala**: Principal town and coffee hub (population ~25,000), capital of Marcala coffee region (Honduras's first Protected Designation of Origin for coffee, 2005)

**Capucas**: Small mountain village (~2,000 people) in Marcala municipality, where cooperative is headquartered

**Altitude Range**: 1,200-1,700 meters above sea level (Capucas member farms)
- Higher elevations (1,500-1,700m) produce most complex, highest-scoring coffees (Bourbon, Caturra micro-lots)
- Lower elevations (1,200-1,400m) higher yields, shorter maturation (Catuai, Lempira)

**Microclimate**: Highland tropical climate, Pacific slope
- **November-March**: Harvest season (dry season, optimal for processing)
- **April-October**: Wet season (2,000-3,000mm annual rainfall)
- Temperature: 15-25°C (cool year-round, elevation-dependent)
- Afternoon clouds and morning mist common (slows maturation)
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (12-18°C), favors quality development

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Volcanic loam and clay, fertile, mineral-rich, well-draining (La Paz's volcanic geology provides excellent coffee soils)

**Topography**: Steep mountain slopes (30-60 degrees common), terracing required, manual cultivation throughout

**Water**: Mountain springs and streams from La Paz highlands, abundant year-round (critical for processing)

**Biodiversity**: Pine-oak cloud forest ecosystem, some primary forest remnants, agricultural landscape mosaic

## Historical Context: Honduran Coffee and Cooperative Movement

### Coffee Introduction and Development (1800s-1970s)

**Coffee Introduction**: Coffee introduced to Honduras 1700s-1800s (Spanish colonial era), commercial production expanded late 1800s

**Marcala Heritage**: La Paz (Marcala region) emerged as premier Honduran coffee region (high altitude, volcanic soils, favorable climate)

**Smallholder Model**: Unlike neighboring Guatemala and El Salvador (plantation-dominated), Honduras coffee primarily smallholder-based (families cultivating 1-5 hectares)

### Crisis and Cooperative Formation (1980s-1990s)

**Coffee Crisis and Middlemen Exploitation**: 1980s-1990s, coffee prices volatile, smallholder farmers at mercy of middlemen buyers (coyotes) who paid exploitative prices, often 50-70% below export value

**Government Inefficiency**: State-run marketing boards (IHC—Honduran Coffee Institute) inefficient, corrupt, delayed payments to farmers

**Farmer Response**: Farmers in Capucas and other regions organized cooperatives (late 1990s), motivated by collective bargaining power, direct market access, fair pricing

### Capucas Cooperative Establishment (1999)

**Founding**: 40 smallholder families organized Cooperativa Capucas (COCAFCAL) in 1999
- Motivation: Escape middlemen exploitation, access better prices, improve quality, invest in community development
- Initial challenges: Lacked processing infrastructure, market connections, capital, technical expertise

**Early Support**: International development NGOs (TechnoServe, USAID, others) provided technical assistance, training, market linkages

**Fair Trade Certification** (2000): Capucas achieved Fair Trade certification early (2000, among Honduras's first cooperatives)
- Guaranteed minimum price, social premiums
- Market access to Fair Trade roasters (North America, Europe)

**Organic Certification** (2002): Transitioned members to organic farming, achieved certification
- Additional premiums (~$0.30/lb)
- Certification costs covered by cooperative (members couldn't afford individually)

### Women's Leadership Emergence (2000s-Present)

**Olga Marina Rodriguez**: Joined cooperative early 2000s, served in various roles, elected president (~2008-2018, 10+ years)
- First woman president in region (highly unusual in male-dominated Honduran coffee)
- Under her leadership: Cooperative expanded from 40 to 550 members, improved quality dramatically, won Cup of Excellence awards, built direct trade relationships, prioritized women's empowerment

**Women's Majority Membership**: As cooperative grew, women membership increased (widows inherited farms, women purchased land, daughters joined with mothers)
- By 2010s: 60% women members (highest percentage in Honduras, rare globally)

**Women's Programs**: Cooperative established women's leadership training, literacy programs, business skills development (under women-led governance, women's needs prioritized)

## Organization Structure: Democratic Cooperative with Women's Leadership

**Membership**: 550 smallholder families (2024)
- Average farm size: 1-3 hectares (small plots, typical of Honduras)
- 60% women members (widows, women landowners, daughters)
- Geographic spread: Capucas village and surrounding 20+ communities

**Governance**: Democratic cooperative structure
- **General Assembly**: All members vote annually on major decisions (budget, premiums allocation, leadership, policies)
- **Board of Directors**: Elected by members, 7-member board (rotating 3-year terms), women majority on board historically
- **President**: Women presidents for 10+ years (Olga Marina Rodriguez most notable, subsequent women leaders)
- **Management Team**: Professional managers (general manager, quality manager, wet mill manager, accountant)

**Member Services**:
- **Technical Training**: Agronomy, selective harvesting, organic farming, climate adaptation (cooperative employs extension agents visit farms)
- **Input Supply**: Organic fertilizers, tools, seedlings sold at cost
- **Credit Access**: Pre-harvest loans (interest-free or low-interest), emergency loans
- **Processing Services**: Centralized wet mills (members deliver cherry), cupping lab (quality evaluation)
- **Marketing and Sales**: Cooperative negotiates contracts, sells on behalf of members, members paid based on quality and quantity
- **Social Programs**: Healthcare, education, women's empowerment funded by Fair Trade premiums

### Organic Farming Practices (100% of members organic-certified)

**Soil Health Management**:
- Compost from coffee pulp and processing waste, animal manure (cattle, chickens)
- Cover crops between coffee rows (legumes, grasses—nitrogen fixation, erosion control)
- Organic fertilizers (plant-based amendments)
- No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers (organic certification requirement)

**Pest and Disease Management**:
- Coffee leaf rust (CLR): Major challenge (Honduras experiences periodic severe outbreaks, 2012-2013 crisis devastated production)
  - Organic management: Pruning, shade management, rust-resistant varieties (Lempira, IHCAFE 90)
  - Some members struggle with lower yields due to rust (organic methods less effective than fungicides)
- Biological control: Birds, beneficial insects (shade trees provide habitat)

**Challenges**: Organic management labor-intensive, yields 10-20% lower than conventional (but premiums offset losses)

### Agroforestry and Shade Management

**Shade Coverage** (40% average):
- Mixed shade: Inga species (nitrogen-fixing, common Central American coffee shade tree), timber trees (cedar, pine), fruit trees (banana, avocado, citrus), native forest trees
- Shade benefits: Moderates temperature, slows maturation (improves cup complexity), reduces coffee leaf rust pressure (lower humidity under moderate shade), diversifies income (fruit, timber sales)

**Forest Conservation**: Some members maintain forest patches on farms (watershed protection, biodiversity), cooperative encourages conservation

### Harvest Management
