# Finca El Injerto

## Overview

Finca El Injerto stands among the world's most celebrated and awarded coffee estates—a 750-hectare family-owned farm (300 hectares in coffee production, 450 hectares forest conservation) in Guatemala's legendary Huehuetenango region, producing 300-500 tons annually of ultra-premium coffees scoring 87-96 points that have shattered auction records and redefined specialty coffee's quality ceiling. Owned by the Aguirre family since 1874 (currently fifth generation), El Injerto achieved global fame by winning Guatemala's Cup of Excellence in 2002 with a then-record auction price of $14.10/lb, and again in 2008 with an astonishing $80.20/lb—at the time the highest price ever paid for coffee at auction (subsequently broken by El Injerto's own 2011 lot at $211.50/lb for Pacamara).

Located in the Huehuetenango highlands (1,500-2,000 MASL) near the Mexican border, El Injerto cultivates an exceptional diversity of varieties—Bourbon, Pacamara, Geisha, Java, Pache, Maragogipe—across distinct microclimates and elevations, processing coffees using traditional washed methods alongside cutting-edge experimental fermentation (anaerobic, extended, carbonic maceration) that push the boundaries of coffee flavor. The estate's relentless pursuit of quality excellence—meticulous cultivation, selective harvesting, innovative processing, rigorous cupping and micro-lot separation—combined with fifth-generation coffee expertise and commitment to sustainability (Rainforest Alliance certified, 60% forest conservation, progressive worker programs) has made El Injerto a global icon and benchmark for specialty coffee's highest possibilities.

Beyond competition success, El Injerto's impact on specialty coffee is profound: the estate demonstrated that exceptional quality commands extraordinary premiums (transforming economics of quality focus), pioneered Pacamara variety development and marketing (now sought globally), and inspired countless producers worldwide to invest in quality, processing innovation, and direct marketing. The Aguirre family's openness—hosting roaster visits, sharing processing knowledge, participating in industry events—has made El Injerto not just a producer but a teacher and leader in specialty coffee's evolution.

## Location and Geography

### Huehuetenango Context: Guatemala's Highland Crown

**Huehuetenango**: Guatemala's westernmost coffee region, bordering Mexico (Chiapas), renowned for producing Guatemala's highest-quality and most distinctive coffees

**Geography**: Dramatic mountain ranges of Sierra de los Cuchumatanes (highest non-volcanic mountains in Central America, peaks >3,800m), deep valleys, steep slopes

**El Injerto Location**: Concepción Huista municipality, Huehuetenango, northwestern highlands
- Estate spans 750 hectares across elevation gradient (1,500-2,000 MASL)
- Higher elevations (1,800-2,000m): Geisha, Pacamara, ultra-premium micro-lots
- Mid elevations (1,600-1,800m): Bourbon, Java, consistent quality
- Lower elevations (1,500-1,600m): Pache, productive varieties

**Microclimate**: Highland tropical climate, protected valley
- **December-March**: Harvest season (dry season, optimal for processing)
- **April-November**: Wet season (2,000-3,000mm annual rainfall)
- Temperature: 12-24°C (cool year-round, elevation-dependent, cold nights at highest elevations)
- Morning mist and afternoon clouds common (cool, humid microclimates favor aromatic development)
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (15-20°C at highest elevations), slows maturation (10-11 months flower to harvest at 2,000m)

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Volcanic loam and limestone-derived soils (complex geology), deep, fertile, mineral-rich, excellent drainage

**Topography**: Extremely steep mountain slopes (40-70 degrees common), requiring terracing and manual cultivation throughout (no mechanization possible)

**Water**: Mountain springs and streams from Cuchumatanes watershed, abundant year-round (critical for processing)

**Biodiversity**: Cloud forest and pine-oak forest ecosystem, 450 hectares conserved
- 300+ bird species documented (migratory and resident)
- Mammals: white-tailed deer, coati, porcupine, agouti
- Reptiles, amphibians, diverse insect and plant life

## Historical Context and Aguirre Family Legacy (1874-Present)

### Founding and Early Generations (1874-1950s)

**Establishment (1874)**: Aguirre family acquired land in Huehuetenango, established coffee cultivation
- Traditional Bourbon and Typica varieties
- Washed processing (Guatemalan tradition)
- Export to European markets (Germany, Scandinavia—Guatemalan coffee's historical markets)

**Generational Continuity**: Aguirre family maintained estate through five generations, navigating Guatemala's turbulent history (political instability, armed conflict 1960-1996, economic volatility)

**Coffee Knowledge**: Multi-generational expertise in Huehuetenango terroir, Bourbon cultivation, washed processing

## Organization Structure: Family Estate Excellence Model

**Ownership**: Aguirre family, fifth generation (Arturo Aguirre leads operations, siblings and extended family involved)

**Management**: Arturo oversees quality, processing, innovation, marketing; family members manage agronomy, administration, logistics

**Land Use**:
- 300 hectares coffee production (varietal and elevation zones, all manual cultivation and harvest)
