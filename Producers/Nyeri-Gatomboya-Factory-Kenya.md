## 🔬 Processing Excellence

**Processing Method**: Washed (Kenyan Double Fermentation)

**Kenyan Washed Process** (Gatomboya Implementation):

1. **Cherry Reception & Sorting** (Day 1, Afternoon)
   - Farmers deliver cherry afternoon/evening
   - Weighed and graded on arrival
   - Floatation tank removes defects
   - Under-ripe/damaged cherry rejected

2. **Pulping** (Day 1, Evening)
   - Mechanical disc pulpers
   - Removes skin and some mucilage
   - Cherry processed within hours of delivery

3. **First Fermentation** (Day 1-2, ~12-24 hours)
   - Parchment in fermentation tanks
   - Natural enzymes break down mucilage
   - Duration depends on temperature
   - Monitored by factory manager

4. **Mid-Process Wash**
   - Parchment washed after first fermentation
   - Remaining mucilage partially removed
   - Sorted by density in washing channels

5. **Second Fermentation** (Day 2-3, ~12-24 hours)
   - Second fermentation tank
   - Further mucilage breakdown
   - This creates Kenya's characteristic clean profile
   - Unique to Kenyan processing

6. **Final Washing** (Day 3)
   - Multiple wash cycles
   - Clean water rinses
   - Grading in washing channels (by density)
   - Results in ultra-clean parchment

7. **Drying** (Day 3-14, 10-14 days)
   - African raised drying beds
   - Sun drying to 10-12% moisture
   - Hand-sorted during drying
   - Turned regularly for even drying
   - Protected from rain/over-drying

8. **Dry Milling & Grading**
   - Sent to dry mill
   - Hulled (parchment removed)
   - Graded by screen size and density
   - AA, AB, PB, C, etc.

**Quality Control**:
- Factory manager oversees all processing
- Strict quality standards
- Defect removal at multiple stages

## 📝 Producer Story

Gatomboya Factory was established in 1964 as part of Kenya's cooperative coffee system. Located in Nyeri County on slopes of Mount Kenya at 1,700-1,900m elevation, it serves ~1,200 smallholder farmers who deliver ripe cherry for processing.

**The Kenyan System**:
After independence (1963), Kenya developed cooperative system enabling smallholder farmers to access international markets. Farmers deliver cherry to cooperative factories (washing stations), which process collectively and sell through Nairobi Coffee Exchange auction. This creates quality control and market access impossible for individual small farmers.

**Nyeri Region**:
Nyeri is Kenya's premier coffee region, known for:
- Rich volcanic soil from Mount Kenya
- Ideal altitude (1,700-2,100m)
- Cool climate, perfect for SL varieties
- Strong cooperative tradition
- Exceptional quality reputation

**Factory Operations**:
Gatomboya processes only fully ripe cherry, using Kenyan double fermentation method that creates characteristic clean, bright profile. Coffee is sun-dried on raised African beds, hand-sorted, then sent to dry mill for grading. The best lots (AA grade) achieve high prices at auction.

**Farmer Impact**:
Cooperative provides crucial market access and fair payment for smallholder farmers. Farmers receive payment based on cherry weight and quality, with bonuses for exceptional lots. The cooperative invests in community development - schools, healthcare, infrastructure.

**Quality Commitment**:
Strict cherry selection and processing standards maintain Gatomboya's reputation at auction. Only ripe cherry accepted, multiple sorting stages, careful fermentation monitoring, and hand-sorting during drying ensure consistent quality.

- Explosive black currant (think Ribena concentrate)
- Bright, phosphoric acidity (different from citric)
- Wine-like complexity and evolution as it cools
- Clean, long finish
- Savory-sweet tomato notes (polarizing but characteristic)

**Best Brewing**:
