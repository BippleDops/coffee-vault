## 🔬 Processing Methods

**Primary Processing**: Washed (Traditional Guatemalan)

**Washed Process Implementation**:

1. **Harvest Selection**:
   - Selective hand-picking
   - Multiple passes during season
   - Only fully ripe cherry
   - Floatation sorting on arrival

2. **Depulping** (Same day):
   - Mechanical disc pulper
   - Within 6 hours of harvest
   - Skin removed, mucilage retained

3. **Fermentation** (12-18 hours):
   - Concrete fermentation tanks
   - Duration depends on temperature (cooler highlands)
   - Natural enzymatic breakdown
   - Monitoring for optimal timing

4. **Washing** (Multiple stages):
   - Clean volcanic spring water
   - Multiple rinse cycles
   - Density sorting in washing channels
   - Visual defect removal

5. **Drying** (10-14 days):
   - Patio drying (concrete/brick)
   - Sun exposure with afternoon covering
   - Turned regularly for even drying
   - Hand-sorting during drying process
   - Target 10-11% moisture

6. **Resting**:
   - Stored in parchment (reposo)
   - 30-60 days before milling
   - Flavor development and stabilization

7. **Dry Milling**:
   - Hulling (parchment removal)
   - Grading by size (SHB - Strictly Hard Bean)
   - Density sorting
   - Final defect removal

**Honey Process** (Experimental, recent):
- Yellow honey (25% mucilage)
- Limited lots for specific roasters
- Careful drying management
- Enhanced sweetness profile

**Quality Control**:
- Multiple sorting stages
- Cupping of all lots before sale
- Moisture monitoring throughout drying
- Defect counting and removal
- Sample roasting and evaluation
