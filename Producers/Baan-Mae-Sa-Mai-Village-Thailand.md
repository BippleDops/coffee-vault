# Baan Mae Sa Mai Village

## Overview

Baan Mae Sa Mai Village represents one of Thailand's most inspiring specialty coffee success stories, transforming from opium cultivation to producing some of Southeast Asia's most sought-after specialty coffees. Located in the mountainous Chiang Mai province of northern Thailand, this village cooperative of 180 Karen and Akha hill tribe families has become a model for sustainable agricultural development and community empowerment in the Golden Triangle region.

Established in 2012 through a Royal Project initiative to provide alternatives to opium production, Baan Mae Sa Mai has evolved from subsistence farming to producing specialty-grade coffees that score 83-88 points and command premium prices in international markets. The cooperative's commitment to quality, environmental stewardship, and cultural preservation has created economic opportunity while maintaining traditional hill tribe values and protecting the surrounding montane forest ecosystem.
