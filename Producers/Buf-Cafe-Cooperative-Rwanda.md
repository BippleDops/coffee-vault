**Rwandan Coffee Context**:
Rwanda produces exceptional high-altitude coffee despite tragic recent history. The 1994 genocide devastated country and coffee industry. Post-genocide, Rwanda rebuilt coffee sector focusing on quality over quantity, specialty markets, washing stations, and cooperative empowerment. Today, Rwanda is specialty coffee star - high altitude, bourbon varieties, meticulous washed processing.

**Post-Genocide Coffee Renaissance**:
After 1994 genocide killed 800,000+ people (70% of coffee farmers murdered):
- Coffee sector destroyed
- Infrastructure demolished
- Knowledge and leadership lost
- Government prioritized coffee as economic renewal path
- USAID and others supported washing station construction
- Quality focus over volume from start
- "Cup of Excellence" and specialty market access

Buf Café formed 10 years post-genocide as part of Rwanda's coffee revival:
- 2,100+ smallholder families organized
- USAID supported washing station construction
- Training in quality processing
- Fair Trade and Organic certification pursuit
- Women's leadership and empowerment focus
- Community healing through cooperation

**Women's Leadership**:
Buf Café is 65% women-owned (extraordinary):

**Typical Altitude**: 1,850 meters
**Terrain**: Steep volcanic mountain slopes, terraced
**Soil Type**: Volcanic, rich in minerals, well-draining
**Microclimate**: Highland tropical, distinct wet/dry seasons

**Rwanda's Altitude Advantage**:
"Land of a Thousand Hills" - Rwanda's mountainous terrain creates ideal coffee conditions:
1. **High Altitude**: 1,700-2,000m produces dense beans, complex flavors
2. **Volcanic Soil**: Mineral-rich, excellent drainage
3. **Cool Nights**: Slow cherry ripening enhances sweetness
4. **Rainfall**: Adequate moisture, distinct dry harvest season
5. **Microclimate Diversity**: Valley and mountain variations

**Production Capacity** (Collective):
- **Annual Production**: 400-600 tons green coffee (cooperative total)
- **Per Washing Station**: 200-300 tons each
- **Production Volume**: Medium cooperative
- **Peak Season**: March - July
- **Harvest Frequency**: Once annually (single harvest)
- **Selective Picking**: Multiple passes, ripeness focus

**Farm Characteristics**:
Members farm tiny plots (0.25-1 hectare):
- Coffee intercropped with food crops (beans, bananas, vegetables)
- Terraced slopes (erosion control)
- Shade trees (banana, nitrogen-fixing)
- Organic by practice (limited resources for chemicals)
- Labor-intensive, hand-cultivated
- Family labor (including children after school)

**Challenges of Scale**:
- Extremely small plots (economic vulnerability)
- Limited resources (equipment, inputs)
- Steep terrain (difficult farming)

## ☕ Varieties Cultivated (By Members)

**Primary Variety**:

1. **Bourbon** (95%+ of cooperative)
   - **Red Bourbon**: Dominant variety in Rwanda
   - Heritage variety (brought by Belgian colonizers 1930s)
   - Exceptional cup quality
   - Adapted to Rwanda's high altitude
   - Lower yield accepted for quality
   - Defines Rwandan coffee profile
   - Cherry color: Red
   - Bean characteristics: Round, dense, complex

**Why Bourbon Dominance**:
- Historical: Planted in colonial era, never replaced
- Quality: Exceptional cup profile (sweet, complex, balanced)
- Altitude Adaptation: Thrives at 1,700-2,000m
- Market Recognition: "Rwandan Bourbon" has specialty prestige
- No Reason to Replace: Quality focus means yield less important

**Minor Varieties**:

2. **Jackson** (5%)
   - Bourbon mutation
   - Some older farms maintain
   - Similar profile to Bourbon

**Varietal Advantage**:
Unlike many origins with variety diversity challenges, Rwanda's Bourbon homogeneity creates:

## 🔬 Processing Methods (Fully Washed Excellence)

**Fully Washed Process** (100% of production)

Rwanda produces exclusively fully washed coffee - government decision post-genocide to compete on quality.

**Why Fully Washed**:
- Clean, bright profile showcases coffee quality
- Specialty market preference
- Quality differentiation from neighbors
- Processing control at washing stations
- Traceability and lot separation
- Premium pricing

**Rwandan Washed Process Implementation**:

**At Farm Level** (Member Farmers):
1. **Selective Harvesting**:
   - Only fully ripe red cherry picked
   - Multiple passes during season (5-7 passes)
   - Training in ripeness selection
   - Quality premiums incentivize care
   - Same-day delivery to washing station (crucial)

**At Washing Station** (Cooperative Processing):

2. **Cherry Reception & Payment**:
   - Delivered same day as picked
   - Weighed and paid (immediately or weekly)
   - Floatation sorting (remove underripes, defects)
   - Quality assessment (ripeness premium paid)

3. **Depulping** (Within 6 hours):
   - Mechanical disc pulpers
   - Skin removed, mucilage retained
   - Sorted by density in depulping

4. **Dry Fermentation** (12-18 hours):
   - Parchment coffee in fermentation tanks
   - Natural enzymatic mucilage breakdown
   - No water added (dry fermentation)
   - Monitored by touch, smell, pH testing
   - Highland altitude = cooler temps = longer fermentation

5. **Washing** (Multiple stages):
   - Clean mountain water
   - Washing channels with density sorting
   - Multiple rinse cycles until completely clean
   - Final rinse inspected for clarity

6. **Soaking** (12-24 hours):
   - Clean water soak (optional but common in Rwanda)
   - Further flavor development
   - Additional quality enhancement
   - Clean water changed regularly

7. **Drying** (14-21 days):
   - Raised African beds (mesh for airflow)
   - Thin, even layers (1-2 cm)
   - Turned every 2-3 hours (first week)
   - Hand-sorted during drying (defect removal)
   - Covered during hottest hours (prevent over-drying, cracking)
   - Night covering (dew and rain protection)
   - Target moisture: 10-11%
   - Slow, controlled drying (never rushed)

8. **Resting**:
   - 30-60 days in parchment
   - Flavor stabilization and development
   - Climate-controlled storage

9. **Dry Milling** (Pre-Export):
   - Hulling (parchment removal)
   - Screen grading
   - Density sorting (using Oliver gravity tables)
   - Hand-sorting (final defect removal)
   - Grading: Screen 15+, A/AA grades

**Quality Control** (Exceptional):

- Drying moisture checks (multiple daily)
- Hand-sorting during drying (continuous defect removal)
- Pre-mill sorting
- Post-mill sorting
- Cupping of every lot (quality verification)
- Lot traceability (station, date, member group)

**Processing Infrastructure** (Each Washing Station):
- Mechanical depulpers (disc pulpers)
- Fermentation tanks (concrete, multiple sizes)
- Washing channels (density sorting, grading)
- 30-50 raised African drying beds
- Covered drying areas (rain protection)
- Moisture meters and monitoring
- Cupping lab and roasting equipment
