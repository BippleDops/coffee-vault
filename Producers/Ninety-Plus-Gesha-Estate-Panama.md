**The Geisha Revolution**:
Ninety Plus focused almost exclusively on Geisha variety from Panama's Boquete region, helping elevate Geisha from obscure variety to world's most sought-after coffee. Their Gesha Estate sits on volcanic slopes of Volcán Barú at ideal altitude (1,600-1,800m) for Geisha cultivation.

**Legacy**:
Beyond producing exceptional coffee, Ninety Plus influenced how specialty coffee industry thinks about processing, quality, and value. They demonstrated that experimental processing could elevate already-exceptional coffee to new levels.
