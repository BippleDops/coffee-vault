# Man Lao Village Cooperative

## Overview

Man Lao Village Cooperative represents China's rapid ascent in specialty coffee, transforming from a remote Lahu ethnic minority village in Yunnan Province's Pu'er Mountains to a quality-focused cooperative producing coffees scoring 83-89 points that showcase China's emerging potential as a serious coffee origin. Established in 2011 in collaboration with coffee development NGOs, the cooperative unites 280 Lahu families cultivating coffee at 1,400-1,800 MASL in biodiverse montane forests, pioneering organic agriculture, processing innovation, and direct trade relationships that challenge global perceptions of Chinese coffee.

China's coffee story is young but explosive: introduced by French missionaries in Yunnan in the late 1800s, large-scale cultivation only began in the 1980s-90s with government agricultural diversification programs. For decades, Chinese coffee meant bulk Catimor for instant coffee processing—low quality, high volume. However, in the 2010s, a specialty coffee revolution emerged: producers like Man Lao Village Cooperative began focusing on quality varieties (Typica, Bourbon, Geisha), meticulous processing, and specialty markets. Combined with China's booming domestic coffee culture (Yunnan's first Starbucks opened 2012, third-wave cafés proliferating), Chinese coffee is transforming from commodity afterthought to emerging specialty origin.

Beyond coffee quality, Man Lao Village exemplifies inclusive rural development for ethnic minorities: the Lahu people, one of Yunnan's 25 ethnic minorities, historically faced poverty and marginalization. Coffee provides economic opportunity while preserving cultural identity. The cooperative's organic certification (2015), processing innovation (honey, natural, anaerobic), women's leadership (51% women members), and commitment to education and cultural preservation demonstrate coffee's potential as engine of sustainable, equitable development in China's ethnic minority regions.

## Location and Geography

### Regional Context

**Yunnan Province**: Southwest China, bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam. Yunnan means "South of the Clouds"—mountainous, biodiverse, ethnically diverse (25 officially recognized ethnic minorities).

**Pu'er City**: Named after famous Pu-erh tea, now also coffee capital of Yunnan. Located in subtropical highlands, ideal coffee terroir.

**Man Lao Village**: Remote Lahu ethnic minority village in Pu'er mountains, Lancang County. Accessible by winding mountain roads (2-3 hours from Pu'er city).

**Altitude**: 1,400-1,800 meters above sea level
- Higher than most Yunnan coffee (bulk production 1,000-1,200m)
- Cool mountain temperatures slow cherry maturation
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (12-18°C)
- Elevation advantage for quality

**Microclimate**: Subtropical highland monsoon climate
- November-March: Dry season, primary harvest period (cool, sunny)
- April-May: Transition, flowering period
- June-October: Monsoon season, heavy rains (warm, humid)
- Annual rainfall: 1,400-1,800mm (concentrated in monsoon)
- Temperature: 15-25°C year-round (elevation-dependent)
- Morning mist common (cloud forest influence)

### Terroir Characteristics

- 30-year land use certificates provide security
- Land inherited within families
- Cooperative coordinates land management while respecting family use rights

### Cultivation Practices

**Transitioning to Quality Focus**:
- Historically: High-density Catimor plantations for bulk production
- 2011 onward: Replanting with quality varieties, reducing density, introducing shade
- Organic transition (2012-2015, certified 2015)
- Agroforestry intensification (diversification, biodiversity, shade coverage)

**Agroforestry System** (50% shade coverage):
- Shade trees: Macadamia (nut income), avocado, walnut (nut crop income diversification)
- Native trees: Albizia, Cinnamomum (cinnamon), others
- Intercropping: Tea (Pu-erh tea traditional to region), vegetables, ginger
- Windbreaks and terracing for erosion control
- Diversified income and ecological benefits

**Organic Agriculture** (certified 2015):
- No synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers
- Compost from coffee pulp, farm waste, livestock manure (pigs, chickens)
- Botanical pest controls (chili pepper spray, neem, garlic)
- Organic transition supported by NGO training and Fair Trade premium
- Challenges: Soil fertility restoration after years of chemicals, pest management learning curve

**Soil Management**:
- Compost application: 3-5kg per tree annually
- Coffee pulp mulch (100% returned to members)
- Cover crops during monsoon season (legumes for nitrogen)
- Terracing on slopes (traditional practice, critical in mountains)
- Erosion control with vegetation barriers

### Variety Selection

**Catimor** (40% of production, declining):
- Legacy variety from 1990s-2000s bulk production era
- High yielding, rust resistant, vigorous
- Moderate cup quality (82-84 points typical)
- Being gradually replaced with quality varieties

**Typica** (30% of production, increasing):
- Introduced 2012 for quality improvement
- Excellent cup quality (85-88 points)
- Lower yielding but price premiums justify
- Thrives at high elevations

**Bourbon** (20% of production, increasing):
- Excellent sweetness and complexity
- Planted 2014 onward
- Cooperative promoting Bourbon expansion

**Geisha** (10% of production, trial plantings):
- Introduced 2017 for ultra-premium positioning
- Early results promising (87-89 points)
- Climate and altitude suitable
- Expanding acreage slowly

**Variety Strategy**:
- Phasing out Catimor (replanting with Typica, Bourbon, Geisha over 10-15 year cycle)
- Goal: 70% quality varieties by 2030
- Cooperative nursery provides seedlings (subsidized for members)
- Variety-specific processing to optimize quality

### Agronomic Practices

**Planting Density**: 1,800-2,500 trees per hectare
- Lower than historical high-density Catimor (3,000-4,000/ha)
- Allows shade integration and intercropping
- Spacing: 2-2.5 meters between rows, 1.5-2 meters between trees

**Pruning System**:
- Selective pruning annually after harvest
- Height management (2-2.5 meters for steep slope harvesting)
- Stumping program for old Catimor trees (rehabilitation or replanting)
- Training provided by cooperative agronomist

**Fertilization** (organic):
- Compost: 3-5kg per tree annually (2-3 applications)
- Coffee pulp mulch (heavy application)
- Manure from livestock (limited availability)
- Foliar sprays with compost tea
- Goal: Increase application rates as organic matter production scales up

**Integrated Pest Management**:
- Coffee leaf rust moderate pressure (monsoon humidity)
- Coffee berry borer present
- Organic copper-based fungicides (limited preventative use)
- Botanical insecticides (chili, neem, garlic preparations)
- Cultural practices: Pruning, sanitation, harvest timing
- Shade and biodiversity reduce pest pressure

### Harvest Management

**Harvest Season**: November-March (peak December-January)
- China's dry season
- Extended harvest due to elevation and variety diversity

**Selective Picking**:
- Training emphasizes ripe cherry selection (cultural shift from mass harvesting)
- Multiple passes (3-5 passes typical)
- Quality incentive payments (tiered pricing by cherry quality)
- Family labor primary workforce (entire village participates during harvest)
- Women and children major harvesters

**Labor Organization**:
- Collective village model (labor exchange, community participation)
- Family and kinship labor
- Payment based on weight and quality (cooperative pays members)
- Harvest integrated with cultural calendar (festivals, traditions)

**Cherry Collection**:
- Village collection point at cooperative processing center
- Daily delivery during harvest (within 4-6 hours of picking)
- Quality sorting (visual, floatation)
- Payment based on weight and quality (immediate payment, cooperative efficiency)
