## 📝 Producer Story

Helsar de Zarcero was established in 2000 as part of Costa Rica's micro-mill revolution. Owned by Volcafé Specialty (ECOM), it operates as estate farm and processing innovation center in Zarcero's highlands (1,700-1,900m).

**The Micro-Mill Revolution**:
Before 2000, Costa Rican coffee system was centralized - farmers sold cherry to large cooperatives or mills. The micro-mill movement democratized processing:
- Farmers/estates control processing
- Experimentation with methods
- Direct relationships with buyers
- Value capture from processing
- Quality differentiation

**Honey Process Innovation**:
Costa Rica pioneered honey processing, and Helsar perfected it. By controlling mucilage retention (0% to 100%), they create spectrum of profiles:
- White/Yellow: Clean with sweetness boost
- Red: Balanced sweetness and fruit
- Black: Intense sweetness, dried fruit

Each requires different drying protocols, moisture management, and quality control. Helsar's mastery made them honey process reference.

**Processing Lab**:
Helsar functions as processing laboratory:
- Testing fermentation protocols
- Anaerobic experiments
- Drying method optimization
- Varietal-process matching
- Quality benchmarking

Results inform not just Helsar but broader Costa Rican coffee industry.

**Quality Focus**:
All processing innovation serves cup quality. Helsar cupping lab evaluates every lot, ensuring processing enhances rather than masks coffee quality. This quality-first approach maintains Costa Rica's clean-cup reputation while expanding flavor diversity.

**Current Operations**:
Helsar balances:
- Traditional washed (Costa Rican identity)
- Honey series (innovation and differentiation)
- Experimental processing (future development)
- Sustainability (environmental and social)
- Education (sharing knowledge)
