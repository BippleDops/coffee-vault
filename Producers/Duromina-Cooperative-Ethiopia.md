## 🔬 Processing - Natural Process Mastery

Duromina is renowned for exceptional natural (dry) processing, Yirgacheffe's traditional method producing floral, fruity, complex coffees.

**Processing Methods**:

**Primary Method - Natural Process** (70%):

Natural processing is Ethiopia's heritage:
- Traditional method for centuries
- Dry climate during harvest (Oct-Jan) perfect for natural
- Creates Yirgacheffe's signature floral, fruity profiles
- Labor-intensive but produces extraordinary complexity

**Natural Process Protocol**:

1. **Cherry Reception** (Daily during harvest):
   - Farmers deliver cherries to cooperative washing station
   - Reception hours: 6am-6pm
   - Quality inspection (ripeness, defects)
   - Underripe cherries rejected or separated
   - Overripe/damaged cherries separated
   - Only ripe, perfect cherries for natural processing
   - Weight recording (farmer payment tracking)

2. **Sorting & Selection**:
   - Hand-sorting on sorting tables
   - Defect removal (sticks, leaves, underripe, damaged)
   - Floatation (water tank, floaters removed)
   - Density sorting (highest quality cherries sink)
   - Multiple quality checkpoints

3. **Drying Initiation** (Same day as delivery):
   - African raised drying beds (mesh, airflow from below)
   - Thin layers (2-4cm depth)
   - Whole cherry drying
   - Immediate drying prevents fermentation defects

4. **Drying Phase 1** (Days 1-7):
   - Turned every 30-60 minutes (prevent over-fermentation)
   - Covered during hottest hours (prevent cracking)
   - Night coverage (dew protection)
   - Moisture reduction (from 60% to ~40%)
   - Critical phase (over-fermentation risk)

5. **Drying Phase 2** (Days 8-21):
   - Turning reduced (every 2-3 hours)
   - Continued sun drying
   - Moisture reduction (40% to 11%)
   - Slower, gentler drying
   - Flavor development

6. **Hand-Sorting During Drying**:
   - Multiple sorting passes
   - Defect removal (visual inspection)
   - Damaged cherries removed
   - Quality obsession

7. **Final Drying** (Days 18-28):
   - Total drying time: 21-28 days
   - Target moisture: 10.5-11.5%
   - Slow, gentle drying crucial for quality
   - Final quality inspection

8. **Resting**:
   - Dried cherry (in hull) rested 30-60 days
   - Moisture stabilization
   - Flavor maturation
   - Warehouse storage (protected)

9. **Dry-Milling** (Pre-Export):
   - Hull and skin removal (dry milling)
   - Green bean extraction
   - Grading (by size and defects)
   - Final quality control
   - Export preparation

**Secondary Method - Washed Process** (30%):

Washed processing for market diversity:

1. **Pulping**: Mechanical pulper, skin removal
2. **Fermentation**: 24-48 hours in tanks (temperature-dependent)
3. **Washing**: Clean water, mucilage removal
4. **Drying**: Raised beds, 10-14 days, 10-11% moisture
5. **Resting**: Parchment rest 30-45 days

**Experimental Processing** (Limited):
- Extended fermentation natural (36-48 hours before drying)
- Anaerobic fermentation (sealed tanks before drying)
- Carbonic maceration (experimental lots)
- Creating unique flavor profiles

**Processing Infrastructure**:
