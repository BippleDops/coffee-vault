## 📝 Producer Story (Regional Federation History)

**Historical Context**:

Coffee arrived in Huila in early 1800s, becoming economic backbone by early 1900s. The Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia (FNC) was established in 1927 to organize and support Colombian coffee farmers during economic crisis.

**Huila Federation Establishment** (1959):

By 1950s, Huila was emerging as major coffee region. In 1959, Huila Coffee Growers Federation was formally established as regional department of FNC, providing:
- Regional organization and representation
- Technical assistance infrastructure
- Collection and processing facilities
- Price stabilization locally

**Growth Era** (1960s-1980s):

Huila production expanded dramatically:
- Smallholder farms proliferated (ideal climate, altitude)
- FNC infrastructure development (roads, schools, health)
- Variety distribution (Caturra, Typica)
- Processing knowledge transfer
- Market access through FNC

By 1980s, Huila was Colombia's largest producing department.

**Coffee Crisis** (1990s-2000s):

**La Roya Epidemic** (2008-2013):
Coffee leaf rust devastated Colombian production:
- 30-50% production losses (severe cases)
- Huila heavily impacted
- Economic crisis for farmers
- FNC response: variety renewal (Castillo promotion)
- Gradual recovery through 2010s

This crisis accelerated Castillo adoption (rust-resistant) but created tension between productivity (Castillo) and quality (Caturra/Typica).

**Specialty Emergence** (2000s-2010s):

Huila positioned as quality leader:
- Cup of Excellence participation (Huila dominance)
- Specialty roaster interest (single-origin Huila demand)
- Micro-lot exports beginning
- Direct trade relationships
- Quality premiums

This created new opportunities for quality-focused farmers.

**Current Era** (2020s):

Huila Federation today represents:
- 80,000+ coffee-growing families
