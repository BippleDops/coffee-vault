# Cooperativa de Café Orgánico (COOPCAFEOR)

## Overview

Cooperativa de Café Orgánico (COOPCAFEOR) represents the Dominican Republic's organic coffee movement and Caribbean specialty potential, uniting 1,400 smallholder families in the Barahona region's Sierra de Bahoruco mountains to produce organic, Bird-Friendly certified coffees scoring 83-88 points that showcase Dominican coffee's balanced, chocolatey profile and biodiversity conservation leadership. Established in 1989 by visionary farmers committed to organic agriculture, COOPCAFEOR pioneered organic certification in the Caribbean (1993), achieved Fair Trade status (2001), and became one of the first cooperatives globally to achieve Smithsonian Bird-Friendly certification (2005), demonstrating coffee's potential to protect migratory birds and Caribbean cloud forests while providing sustainable livelihoods.

The Dominican Republic, sharing the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has cultivated coffee since the 18th century (introduced by French colonists). Historically overshadowed by neighbors Jamaica (Blue Mountain prestige) and Puerto Rico (now-defunct coffee sector), Dominican coffee remained a hidden gem. The Barahona region, with its volcanic soils, high altitude (900-1,600 MASL), and cloud forests, produces exceptional quality—mild, balanced, chocolatey, clean—that appeals to specialty roasters seeking approachable, versatile profiles. COOPCAFEOR's commitment to organic and bird-friendly practices elevates Dominican coffee from commodity anonymity to specialty recognition.

Beyond exceptional coffee quality and environmental stewardship, COOPCAFEOR exemplifies community-driven development: 42% women members (increasing through active outreach), Fair Trade premiums building schools and health clinics serving 6,000+ people, youth training programs securing next-generation farmers, and reforestation initiatives (500,000+ trees planted) restoring degraded lands and protecting watersheds. The cooperative's full name—"Cooperative of Organic Coffee"—reflects founding commitment to environmental sustainability that has defined its identity for 35+ years.
