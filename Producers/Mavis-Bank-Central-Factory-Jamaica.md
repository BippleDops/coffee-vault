# Mavis Bank Central Factory

## Overview

Mavis Bank Central Factory represents the pinnacle of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee—one of the world's most prestigious and expensive coffees. Established in 1923 in the heart of the Blue Mountains, the factory processes cherries from 5,000 smallholder families cultivating Typica heirloom at 900-1,700 MASL, producing coffees scoring 84-90 points that command $40-80+/lb retail prices. Jamaica Blue Mountain's legendary reputation—smooth, balanced, mild, sweet, exceptionally clean—has made it the most sought-after coffee in Japan (which purchases 80% of production) and a symbol of luxury globally.

Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is protected by geographical indication and strict quality standards: only coffee grown in designated parishes (St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland, St. Mary) at specific altitudes (above 900m) and meeting quality standards can use the "Jamaica Blue Mountain" name. This protection ensures quality and commands premium pricing unmatched by almost any other origin. Mavis Bank, as the oldest and largest processor (40% of Blue Mountain production), exemplifies the traditional quality and meticulous standards that have maintained Blue Mountain's prestige for over a century.

Beyond exceptional quality, Mavis Bank supports 5,000 small-holder families across the Blue Mountains, providing stable income, quality premiums, and community development. The cooperative model, combined with long-term relationships with Japanese trading houses (some spanning 50+ years), creates economic stability rare in coffee. Environmental stewardship—60% shade, steep mountain terracing, watershed protection—preserves the Blue Mountains' stunning natural beauty and ecological significance.

## Location and Geography

### Blue Mountains Context

**Blue Mountains**: Jamaica's highest mountain range (Blue Mountain Peak 2,256m), running east-west across eastern Jamaica. Named for blue mist that shrouds peaks.

**Designated Coffee Parishes**: St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland, St. Mary
- Strict altitude requirements: 900-1,700m for Blue Mountain designation (higher altitudes command highest premiums)
- Below 900m: "High Mountain" or "Jamaica Supreme" (lower designation, lower price)

**Altitude Range**: 900-1,700 meters above sea level
- Dramatic elevation gradient creates diverse microclimates
- Higher elevations (1,400-1,700m) produce most complex, highest-priced coffees
- Cool mountain temperatures slow maturation (8-10 months flower to harvest)
- Significant diurnal temperature variation (12-18°C)

**Microclimate**: Tropical mountain climate, high rainfall
- September-March: Harvest season (cooler, drier but still humid)
- April-August: Wet season, heavy rainfall
- Annual rainfall: 2,500-5,000mm (extremely high, supports lush rainforest)
- Morning mist and afternoon clouds (year-round characteristic)
- Temperature: 10-25°C (elevation-dependent, cool year-round)
- Hurricanes occasional threat (Jamaica in hurricane belt)

### Terroir Characteristics

**Soil**: Volcanic loam derived from ancient volcanic activity, deep, fertile, well-draining

**Topography**: Extremely steep mountain slopes (40-70 degrees common), requiring extensive terracing

**Water**: Mountain springs and streams abundant (high rainfall year-round)

**Biodiversity**: Blue Mountains National Park (UNESCO World Heritage Site candidate), rainforest ecosystem, endemic species

## Organization Structure

### Cooperative Processor Model

**Established**: 1923 by government initiative to support smallholder coffee farmers

**Ownership**: Cooperative owned by member farmers, operates as central processing facility

**Membership**: 5,000 smallholder families
- Average farm size 1-2 hectares (small mountain plots)
- Families cultivate coffee for generations (multi-generational tradition)
- 38% women members (increasing through outreach)

**Governance**: Board of Directors elected by members, management team operates factory

## Farm Characteristics

### Cultivation Practices

**Blue Mountain Typica**: Heirloom variety cultivated in Jamaica 300+ years, perfectly adapted to Blue Mountains. Tall-growing, low-yielding, exceptional cup quality.

**Agroforestry** (60% shade): Native rainforest trees, fruit trees (banana, citrus, avocado, breadfruit), nitrogen-fixing shade trees

**Organic by Practice**: Most farmers use minimal inputs due to cost and remote locations (de facto organic, though not certified)

**Terracing**: Extensive stone and vegetation terraces prevent erosion on steep slopes (traditional practice, maintained over decades)

### Harvest Management

**Harvest Season**: September-March (peak November-January)

**Selective Picking**: Only fully ripe cherries harvested, multiple passes (4-6), family labor primary workforce

**Cherry Delivery**: Farmers deliver to Mavis Bank factory or satellite collection points daily, quality sorting and payment

## Processing Methods

### Mavis Bank Facility

**Infrastructure**: Large-scale wet mill and dry mill, established 1923, continuously upgraded

**Capacity**: Processes 800-1,200 tons green coffee equivalent annually (40% of total Blue Mountain production)

**Traditional Washed Processing**:
1. Cherry reception and sorting (floatation, visual)
2. Pulping (mechanical disc pulpers)
3. Fermentation (underwater fermentation, 18-36 hours, cool mountain temperatures)
4. Washing (multiple stages, density separation)
5. Drying (patio drying on concrete slabs, 10-15 days to 11-12% moisture)
6. Resting (60-90 days for flavor development)
7. Hulling, grading, sorting (extensive hand sorting, multiple passes)

### Quality Control

**Jamaica Coffee Industry Board (CIB) Oversight**: Government agency regulates all Blue Mountain coffee, ensures quality standards, approves grading

**Grading System**:
- Blue Mountain No. 1 (screen 17/18, highest grade, premium pricing)
- Blue Mountain No. 2 (screen 16, slight quality discount)
- Blue Mountain No. 3 (screen 15, lower price)
- Peaberry (separate designation, small round beans, unique profile)

**Defect Standards**: Strict limits on defects, multiple hand-sorting stages ensure cleanliness

**Moisture and Density**: Rigorously controlled and tested

**Community Development**: Cooperative supports education, healthcare, infrastructure for member families

**Challenges**: High production costs (labor, steep terrain, inputs), hurricane risk, climate change (temperatures rising, threatening altitude advantage)

## Producer Story and Cultural Context

### Historical Context

**Coffee Introduction**: Coffee introduced to Jamaica 1728 (from Martinique), Typica variety thrived in Blue Mountains

**Colonial Era**: British colonial estates, large plantations, later transitioned to smallholder model post-independence (1962)

### Jamaica Blue Mountain Mystique

**Prestige Factors**:
- Legendary smoothness and balance
- Protected geographical indication
- Limited supply (scarcity creates demand)
- Japanese market devotion
- High prices reinforce luxury perception
- Wooden barrel packaging (aesthetic prestige)

**Criticisms and Debates**:
- Some specialty coffee professionals argue Blue Mountain is overpriced for quality level (84-90 points good but not exceptional compared to 90+ coffees from other origins at lower prices)
- "Emperor's New Clothes" debate: Is reputation justified or inflated by marketing and tradition?
- Counterargument: Balance, smoothness, and consistency are exceptional, Japanese market values different qualities than Western specialty focus on intensity and complexity

### Vision

**Mavis Bank Mission**: Maintain Jamaica Blue Mountain's legendary quality and reputation, support smallholder farmers, preserve Blue Mountain heritage and environment

**Challenges**: Climate change (temperatures rising, threatening altitude advantage), hurricane risk, production costs, maintaining quality standards

**Future**: Continued focus on quality, Japanese market partnerships, potential for domestic tourism and value addition

## Sustainability and Environmental Stewardship

**Watershed Protection**: Blue Mountains are watershed for eastern Jamaica, coffee cultivation with shade and terracing protects water quality

**Biodiversity**: Blue Mountains National Park adjacent, coffee farms provide habitat connectivity, endemic bird species (Jamaican Blackbird, others) use coffee landscapes

**Climate Vulnerability**: Rising temperatures threaten altitude advantage (coffee may need to move higher, but running out of mountain), adaptation strategies under development
