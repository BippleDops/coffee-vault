## 🔬 Processing Methods

San Sebastián specializes in traditional washed processing with recent honey and natural process experimentation.

**Primary Processing - Washed** (85% of production):

**Washed Process Protocol**:
1. **Harvest**: Selective picking, ripe cherries only
2. **Reception**: Immediate sorting, defect removal
3. **Flotation**: Water flotation removes floaters (underripe, defects)

6. **Washing**: Clean water washing, multiple rinses
7. **Drying**: Patio drying 10-14 days, turned regularly
8. **Resting**: Parchment rest 30-45 days
9. **Milling**: Dry-milling before export

**Fermentation Precision**:
- Temperature monitoring (fermentation time adjusted)
- Cool nights = longer fermentation (24+ hours)
- Warm days = shorter fermentation (16-18 hours)
