## User-Facing Docs (Kept at Root)

These essential files remain at vault root for immediate access:
- **README.md** - Repository overview
- **START-HERE.md** - Quick start guide
- **HOME-DASHBOARD.md** - Daily command center
- **COFFEE-VAULT-QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - One-page reference

## Accessing Meta Documentation

**From Command Palette**: Search for specific document names  
**From File Explorer**: Enable "Show hidden folders" in Obsidian  
**From Terminal**: `cd .vault-meta && ls`

## Why Hidden?

- Reduces root-level clutter for better user experience
- Maintains clean visual hierarchy
- Preserves historical context without overwhelming new users
- Follows Unix convention (`.` prefix for system files)
- Keeps implementation details separate from user documentation
