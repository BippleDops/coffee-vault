### Coffee 101: Scientific Basics

Learn the fundamentals that make great coffee:

#### 🔬 Extraction Basics
**What is extraction?** The process of dissolving coffee's flavors into water.
- **Under-extracted** (sour, weak): Need finer grind or more time
- **Over-extracted** (bitter, harsh): Need coarser grind or less time
- **Just right** (balanced, sweet): You're doing great!

**Learn more**: [[Scientific References/Extraction Science/Coffee-Brewing-Control-Chart|Brewing Control Chart]]

#### ⚙️ Grind Size Fundamentals
**Why it matters**: Grind size controls how fast water extracts coffee.

| Grind Size | Looks Like | Best For | Brew Time |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Coarse | Sea salt | French Press | 4+ minutes |
| Medium | Sand | Drip, Pour-over | 2-4 minutes |
| Fine | Table salt | Espresso, AeroPress | 30s-2 min |

**Visual guide**: Think of grind size like a dial - start medium and adjust from there!

#### 🌡️ Water Temperature Effects
**Temperature matters more than you think!**

- **195-205°F (90-96°C)**: Optimal range for most coffee
- **Too hot** (>205°F): Bitter, harsh flavors
- **Too cold** (<195°F): Sour, weak extraction

**Pro tip**: If you don't have a thermometer, let boiling water rest 30 seconds before brewing.

**Learn more**: [[Scientific References/Water Chemistry/Water-Temperature-and-Extraction|Temperature Science]]

### 📖 Glossary of Terms

**Common coffee words you'll hear:**

- **Bloom**: Initial pour to release CO2 (coffee "blooms" and expands)
- **Channeling**: Water finding easy paths, causing uneven extraction
- **Cupping**: Professional coffee tasting method
- **Dose**: Amount of coffee used (in grams)
- **Ratio**: Coffee to water ratio (e.g., 1:15 = 1g coffee to 15g water)
- **TDS**: Total Dissolved Solids - measures coffee strength
- **Yield**: Total brewed coffee amount

**See full glossary**: [[Documentation/Coffee-Terminology-Glossary|Coffee Terms A-Z]]

## 📈 Simple Visualizations

### Your Flavor Compass

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    date as "Date",
    beans as "Coffee",
    rating as "Rating",
    flavor-notes[0] as "Primary Flavor"
FROM "Coffee Logs"
WHERE type = "coffee-log" AND flavor-notes
SORT date DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**What you're learning to taste:**
- **Fruity**: Berry, citrus, stone fruit notes
- **Sweet**: Chocolate, caramel, honey
- **Floral**: Jasmine, rose, tea-like
- **Nutty**: Almond, hazelnut, peanut

> **Tip**: Can't taste complex flavors yet? That's normal! Your palate develops over time.

### Brewing Triangle (Basic)

**The three pillars of good coffee:**

```
        ☕ TASTE
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
    TIME  — GRIND
```

**How to use it:**
- **Sour/Weak?** → Finer grind OR longer time
- **Bitter/Strong?** → Coarser grind OR shorter time
- **Just right?** → Write it down and repeat it!

Inconsistent results | Focus on measuring everything | [[Brewing Guides/Consistency-Tips|Consistency Guide]]
Lost or confused | Come back to this dashboard! | [[START-HERE|Start Here Guide]]

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not measuring** - Eyeballing leads to inconsistency
2. **Using old coffee** - Coffee is best within 2-4 weeks of roast date
3. **Boiling water directly** - Let it cool 30s after boiling
4. **Giving up too soon** - Your 10th brew will be much better than your 1st!
5. **Comparing yourself to pros** - Everyone started where you are

### FAQ for Beginners

**Q: How much should I spend on a grinder?**
A: $40-100 for hand grinder, $100-300 for electric. Grinder matters more than brewer!

**Q: What coffee should I buy?**
A: Start with washed Ethiopian or Colombian, light-medium roast, from a local specialty roaster.

**Q: How do I know if I'm doing it right?**
A: If it tastes good to you, you're doing it right! Coffee is personal.

**Q: Why log at all?**
A: Logging helps you remember what worked and learn faster. Plus, analytics unlock at 10 brews!

**Q: What's the best brewing method?**
A: The one you'll use consistently! Start with what you have or what seems fun.
