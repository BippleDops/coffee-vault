# PT's Coffee

## Overview

PT's Coffee represents one of America's most influential specialty coffee roasters, a Kansas-based company that has shaped specialty coffee culture through unprecedented barista championship success, comprehensive education programs, and unwavering commitment to quality excellence from an unlikely geographic location. Founded in 1993 by Doug and Peggy Welsh in Topeka, Kansas, PT's emerged at specialty coffee's early development stages when quality-focused roasters were rare outside major coastal cities.

The company's name derives from the founders' initials—Peggy and Todd (later changed to PT's Coffee as the company evolved beyond personal identification). From its founding, PT's embodied values distinguishing it from both commodity coffee and early specialty roasters: absolute quality obsession, direct producer relationships prioritizing mutual benefit, extensive education programs developing coffee professional expertise, and belief that Midwest location didn't preclude quality excellence or industry leadership.

What distinguishes PT's most profoundly is the extraordinary barista championship success that has made the roaster legendary in specialty coffee competition circles. PT's baristas have won the United States Barista Championship multiple times and achieved numerous top placements, creating an unmatched competition record. This championship dominance built PT's reputation for coffee quality and barista training excellence while establishing Topeka, Kansas as an unlikely specialty coffee powerhouse.

The championship success emerged from PT's systematic investment in barista training, commitment to sourcing exceptional competition-quality coffee, and culture emphasizing skill development and excellence pursuit. PT's treats barista education as core mission rather than peripheral training, investing substantial resources in comprehensive programs that develop technical expertise, sensory capabilities, and professional knowledge. This education commitment has trained hundreds of coffee professionals who now work throughout specialty coffee.

PT's geographic location in Topeka, Kansas—far from coastal coffee capitals—profoundly influenced the company's development and identity. The Midwest location provided lower operating costs allowing greater investment in coffee quality and education, created culture emphasizing substance over trendy positioning, and required building credibility through demonstrated excellence rather than geographic proximity to coffee culture centers. The Kansas roots created both challenges in establishing national reputation and opportunities to prove that quality excellence transcends location.

The company's Direct Trade program emphasizes long-term producer relationships, quality collaboration, and fair pricing supporting sustainable farming. PT's travels regularly to coffee origins, establishing partnerships based on mutual respect and shared quality commitments. These relationships allow PT's to source exceptional coffees while supporting producers in quality improvement and sustainable practices.

PT's growth through three decades parallels specialty coffee's evolution from niche movement to established industry sector. The company has navigated multiple coffee industry changes including third-wave emergence, corporate consolidation, specialty coffee's geographic expansion, and evolving consumer expectations around sustainability and transparency. Throughout these changes, PT's has maintained independence, quality focus, and commitment to education and competition excellence.

Today, PT's operates eight Kansas locations, roasts hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, maintains extensive wholesale partnerships across multiple states, and continues producing industry-leading barista training and competition success. The company competes in a specialty coffee landscape far more crowded and sophisticated than when PT's founded, requiring ongoing innovation and excellence demonstration to maintain reputation and market position.

PT's legacy extends beyond its own operations to encompass training hundreds of coffee professionals, establishing Midwest specialty coffee credibility, demonstrating that geographic diversity strengthens rather than dilutes specialty coffee, and proving that sustained excellence in education and competition creates industry influence that scale and marketing cannot replicate.

## Company History and Evolution

### Founding and Early Development (1993-2000)

PT's Coffee began in 1993 when Doug and Peggy Welsh, recognizing Topeka's lack of quality coffee and seeing opportunity to bring specialty coffee to Kansas, opened their first location. The founders had developed coffee enthusiasm through travel and quality coffee experiences elsewhere, leading them to envision creating similar quality in Kansas. The founding reflected both coffee passion and entrepreneurial ambition, betting that Kansas consumers would embrace quality coffee if presented with excellence.

The first PT's location established design and service principles that would characterize the company: welcoming environments emphasizing hospitality and community connection, knowledgeable staff who could discuss coffee origins without pretension, quality focus in coffee sourcing and preparation, and commitment to education and continuous improvement. These principles distinguished PT's from commodity coffee while creating accessible rather than elitist coffee culture.

The early years involved significant challenges including limited specialty coffee infrastructure in Kansas, need to educate consumers about specialty coffee value and quality differences, difficulty sourcing exceptional green coffee without established relationships or geographic proximity to importers, and skepticism about whether quality coffee could succeed in markets without existing specialty coffee culture. The Welshs addressed these challenges through persistence, quality demonstration, and genuine customer engagement.

PT's early sourcing emphasized building relationships with coffee importers and establishing direct communication with producers when possible. Doug Welsh began traveling to coffee origins in PT's early years, visiting Guatemala, Costa Rica, and other origins to understand production conditions, meet farmers, and evaluate quality. These origin trips, expensive and time-consuming for a small company, reflected commitment to direct relationships and quality understanding from PT's beginning.

The roasting operation started small, with batch roasting allowing careful attention to roast development. PT's roasted frequently in small quantities, prioritizing freshness and quality over production efficiency. The roasting philosophy emphasized preserving origin characteristics through light-to-medium roasting, avoiding darker roasts that created uniformity through caramelization. This approach aligned with emerging specialty coffee values but was uncommon in Kansas markets.

The company's growth through the 1990s came through building local reputation, establishing wholesale partnerships with Kansas restaurants and cafes, and gradually expanding the retail cafe business. The growth was organic rather than venture capital-funded, requiring profitability at each stage to support expansion. This bootstrap approach created financial discipline while ensuring growth didn't outpace operational capacity or quality maintenance.

PT's commitment to education emerged early, with the company providing barista training for staff and wholesale partners. The training covered espresso fundamentals, brewing techniques, equipment maintenance, and coffee knowledge. While early training programs were informal compared to later systematic curricula, they established education as PT's core value and competitive advantage.

### Barista Championship Era Begins (2000-2010)

PT's emergence as barista championship powerhouse began in the early 2000s when the company started supporting baristas through United States Barista Championship competitions. The championship participation emerged from PT's education culture and recognition that competition provided intensive professional development opportunities while building company credibility and visibility.

The first championship successes came when PT's baristas began placing in top finishes at regional and national competitions, demonstrating exceptional coffee preparation skills, sophisticated coffee knowledge, and presentation abilities. These early successes validated PT's training programs while attracting ambitious baristas interested in competition and professional development. The competition visibility built PT's national reputation despite the Kansas location.

Mike Phillips won the United States Barista Championship in 2009 while working for PT's, creating the company's first USBC title and establishing PT's as national competition force. Phillips' victory resulted from exceptional coffee sourcing, meticulous preparation, and presentation communicating coffee quality and story compellingly. The championship win brought PT's extensive media attention and industry recognition, demonstrating that Kansas-based roaster could compete with and defeat coastal competitors.

The championship success continued with additional PT's baristas winning USBC titles in subsequent years, creating unprecedented championship record. Pete Licata won in 2013, Katie Carguilo in 2018, and other PT's baristas achieved multiple top-six finishes. This sustained championship dominance was extraordinary, representing statistical anomaly in championship competitions where diverse roasters typically succeed rather than single company repeatedly winning.

The championship success emerged from systematic competition preparation programs that PT's developed and refined. The company provided competition participants with practice time, high-quality competition coffee, coaching and feedback, equipment access and technical support, and financial support for competition expenses. This comprehensive support required substantial resource investment but created professional development opportunities while building PT's reputation.

The competition coffee sourcing pushed PT's quality standards even higher, as championship performance required exceptional coffees with clarity, complexity, and flavor intensity impressing judges evaluating dozens of presentations. PT's sought competition-quality lots from producers, often paying premium prices for small quantities of meticulously processed coffee. These competition coffees sometimes became commercial offerings, raising PT's overall quality level.

The barista training programs that supported championship success evolved into comprehensive education initiatives serving PT's staff and broader coffee community. PT's developed systematic curricula covering espresso preparation, sensory development, cupping protocols, brewing techniques, equipment knowledge, and customer service. The programs progressed from foundational competencies through advanced expertise, creating professional development pathways.

The company's wholesale business expanded significantly during this period, with PT's supplying coffee to cafes, restaurants, and institutions across Kansas and increasingly in other states. The championship success built credibility that supported wholesale growth, as accounts associated PT's coffee with quality excellence and professional expertise. The wholesale expansion required roasting capacity increases and quality control system development maintaining consistency.

PT's opened additional Kansas locations during this growth phase, bringing the company to different markets and serving broader audiences. Each location maintained PT's emphasis on quality and hospitality while adapting to local contexts. The expansion demonstrated PT's success while creating challenges around culture maintenance and quality consistency across multiple locations.

### National Recognition and Education Leadership (2010-2020)

PT's evolution into nationally recognized education leader during the 2010s built on championship success while expanding programs serving coffee professionals beyond PT's own staff and wholesale partners. The company recognized that training programs supporting competition success could benefit the broader coffee community, reflecting belief that industry improvement required accessible professional development.

The training programs expanded to include comprehensive curricula for coffee professionals at all skill levels, from entry-level baristas through experienced coffee buyers and quality control professionals. PT's offered courses covering espresso fundamentals, advanced extraction theory, sensory training, cupping protocols, brewing science, green coffee evaluation, and coffee business management. The programs combined hands-on practice with conceptual understanding, emphasizing skill development supported by knowledge.

The sensory training programs particularly influenced specialty coffee professional development, providing systematic education in flavor identification, intensity calibration, quality assessment, and cupping protocols. PT's sensory courses trained participants in recognizing specific flavor notes, calibrating intensity perception against reference standards, identifying defects and quality attributes, and communicating sensory experiences clearly. Graduates often pursued Q Grader certification or professional cupping roles.

PT's partnered with the Specialty Coffee Association and other industry organizations to offer certification programs and support professional development initiatives. The company hosted SCA courses, provided instructors for industry education programs, and contributed to curriculum development. These partnerships extended PT's educational influence while supporting industry-wide professional development infrastructure.

The championship success continued through the 2010s with additional USBC wins and top finishes, maintaining PT's reputation as premier competition training ground. The sustained success attracted ambitious baristas from across the country, with coffee professionals relocating to Kansas specifically to work for PT's and access competition preparation programs. This talent attraction was extraordinary given Topeka's location and size, demonstrating that company culture and training created value overcoming geographic limitations.

However, the championship dominance also generated some criticism and questions about whether PT's success resulted from training excellence or simply from having resources to support extensive competition preparation that smaller companies couldn't match. PT's defended its approach by noting that competition preparation was available to all staff, that training programs served the broader community, and that success resulted from culture emphasizing excellence rather than simply financial resources.

The Direct Trade program formalization during this period created systematic frameworks for producer relationships and sourcing protocols. PT's established criteria for Direct Trade partnerships including direct communication and regular farm visits, multi-year purchasing commitments, quality standards and cupping protocols, prices substantially above commodity markets, and collaborative quality improvement support. These principles distinguished PT's sourcing from conventional trading while supporting producer sustainability.

The sourcing relationships concentrated in Central America and East Africa, with particularly significant partnerships in Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Guatemalan relationships included work with cooperatives and estates across multiple regions. Costa Rican partnerships emphasized micro-mill innovations and processing experimentation. Ethiopian sourcing focused on specific washing stations producing exceptional natural and washed process coffees.

PT's investment in environmental sustainability expanded during this period, including energy-efficient Loring roaster installation reducing fuel consumption and emissions, comprehensive recycling and waste reduction programs, sustainable packaging exploration, and carbon footprint tracking. The company pursued sustainability improvements while acknowledging that coffee production and transportation inherently generated significant environmental impacts requiring ongoing mitigation efforts.

## Barista Education and Competition Training

PT's barista education programs represent the company's most distinctive contribution to specialty coffee, having trained hundreds of coffee professionals and created unprecedented competition success through systematic skill development and knowledge transfer. The programs demonstrate that comprehensive education creates competitive advantage while serving broader industry improvement objectives.

The training philosophy emphasizes progressive skill development through structured curricula, hands-on practice supported by conceptual understanding, continuous feedback and assessment, and culture emphasizing excellence and improvement. PT's treats education as core mission rather than cost center, investing substantial resources in training programs that may not generate direct financial returns but create long-term value through reputation, talent development, and industry contribution.

The foundational barista training covers espresso preparation fundamentals including grinding and dosing consistency, extraction parameter control, milk texturing and latte art, beverage composition and recipe execution, equipment operation and maintenance, and workflow efficiency and customer service. New employees progress through systematic curricula building skills from basic competencies through intermediate proficiency. The training balances technical precision with hospitality values, recognizing that excellent coffee service requires both quality preparation and genuine engagement.

Advanced barista training addresses sophisticated topics including extraction theory and troubleshooting, sensory evaluation and quality assessment, brew ratio optimization and recipe development, equipment calibration and advanced techniques, and competition preparation and presentation skills. Advanced programs serve experienced baristas seeking professional development and individuals interested in competition participation or specialized roles.

The sensory training specifically develops palate sophistication through flavor identification exercises, intensity calibration protocols, cupping fundamentals and advanced techniques, quality assessment and scoring, and defect recognition and coffee evaluation. PT's conducts regular cupping sessions exposing staff to diverse coffees and flavor profiles, developing sensory capabilities supporting both coffee preparation and customer communication.

The competition preparation programs provide comprehensive support for baristas pursuing championship participation. The support includes extensive practice time with competition-quality coffee, coaching from experienced competitors and judges, presentation development and refinement, equipment access and technical assistance, and financial support for competition expenses including registration, travel, and materials. The comprehensive support creates competition excellence while developing professional capabilities transferring beyond competition contexts.

The training extends beyond PT's staff to serve coffee professionals from other companies and individuals interested in coffee careers. PT's offers public classes, workshops, and consulting services sharing knowledge with the broader community. This openness reflects belief that industry improvement requires accessible education rather than treating knowledge as proprietary competitive advantage.

PT's has developed extensive training materials, assessment protocols, and certification processes supporting structured learning pathways. The materials are regularly updated incorporating new research, evolving best practices, and feedback from participants and instructors. The systematic curriculum development creates knowledge infrastructure that can scale and persist beyond individual instructors.

## Coffee Sourcing and Quality Philosophy

PT's approach to coffee sourcing emphasizes long-term producer relationships, collaborative quality development, and transparent practices supporting sustainable farming and exceptional coffee. The sourcing philosophy recognizes that coffee quality emerges from agricultural practices, processing excellence, and mutually beneficial partnerships between producers and roasters.

The Direct Trade program establishes clear criteria for producer partnerships: direct communication through farm visits and ongoing dialogue, multi-year purchasing commitments providing producer stability, quality standards and cupping protocols establishing expectations, prices substantially above commodity markets reflecting quality and costs, and collaborative support for quality improvement and innovation. These principles create relationships based on mutual respect and shared success rather than transactional commodity procurement.

PT's sourcing team travels regularly to coffee origins, visiting producers, evaluating harvests, providing quality feedback, and understanding production conditions and challenges. The origin trips serve multiple purposes including relationship maintenance, quality assessment and coffee selection, understanding how climate and market conditions affect production, and collaborating on quality improvement and processing innovation. The direct engagement allows PT's to understand coffee more completely than purchasing through importers would permit.

The quality assessment emphasizes cup quality evaluated through systematic cupping protocols alongside understanding of agricultural practices, processing excellence, and terroir factors. PT's cups extensively, evaluating hundreds of samples annually to identify coffees meeting the company's standards. The cupping assesses flavor clarity and complexity, balance and structure, distinctive character, absence of defects, and overall quality level.

The sourcing concentrates in origins known for quality potential including Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia, and others. Guatemalan relationships provide complex, terroir-expressive coffees from high-altitude regions. Costa Rican partnerships emphasize micro-mill innovation and processing experimentation. Ethiopian sourcing focuses on specific washing stations and cooperatives producing distinctive natural and washed process coffees. Kenyan lots offer structured acidity and complexity from cooperatives committed to quality.

PT's emphasizes producer partnerships that span many years, creating sustained relationships allowing for quality development and mutual investment over time. Long-term partnerships mean PT's and producers can collaborate on variety selection, processing innovation, and agricultural improvements knowing that the relationship will continue. The sustained engagement creates trust enabling honest feedback and shared problem-solving.

The pricing reflects quality assessment, production costs, and value the coffee creates. PT's pays premiums substantially above commodity markets, with exact amounts depending on quality level and production costs. The pricing must cover PT's costs while providing producers with sustainable livelihoods and quality incentives. The company negotiates prices with producers based on quality and costs rather than imposing prices based on market minimums.

However, PT's acknowledges that Direct Trade has limitations including relationship-intensive approach limiting partnership numbers, focus on quality meaning work primarily with producers already achieving high standards, and premium pricing raising questions about accessibility and whether specialty coffee serves limited elite producers rather than broader farming communities.

## Roasting Philosophy and Production Systems

PT's roasting philosophy emphasizes revealing each coffee's distinctive characteristics through precise roast development calibrated to coffee's specific properties and intended use. The approach combines systematic quality control with adaptability to individual coffees, avoiding standardized roasting that creates uniformity rather than celebrating diversity.

The roasting equipment includes Loring roasters providing precise heat control, environmental efficiency, and production consistency. The Loring systems allow detailed roast profiling with temperature and air flow adjustments achieving specific development objectives. The equipment reduces fuel consumption and emissions compared to traditional drum roasters, supporting PT's environmental sustainability commitments.

The roasting team executes profiles developed through extensive cupping-based experimentation, constantly refining approaches based on coffee performance and feedback. Roasters adjust profiles based on coffee density, moisture content, intended brewing method, and desired flavor profile. The iterative development process means roast profiles evolve as understanding deepens and preferences change.

The roast development typically emphasizes light-to-medium profiles preserving origin characteristics and acidity structure while developing sweetness and reducing harsh notes. PT's avoids under-roasting that leaves coffee grassy or sour and over-roasting creating uniformity through caramelization. The target is achieving each coffee's optimal development where complexity, sweetness, and clarity balance while preserving distinctive character.

The quality control systems include systematic cupping of production roasts, sample roasting before production runs, green coffee evaluation protocols, and comprehensive tracking of quality metrics. The quality team cups multiple samples from each production roast, evaluating against established standards and comparing to reference samples. Production roasts failing quality standards are rejected rather than sold, maintaining absolute quality commitments even when rejection creates financial costs.

PT's roasting protocols acknowledge that different coffees require different development approaches. Dense, high-grown coffees might need longer development achieving proper sugar development while maintaining acidity. Lower-density coffees might require gentler heat application avoiding overdevelopment. Competition coffees might receive special attention achieving maximum clarity and complexity. The customized approach requires roaster expertise and extensive coffee knowledge.

## Current Operations and Industry Position

PT's Coffee currently operates eight Kansas locations, maintains extensive wholesale partnerships serving hundreds of accounts across multiple states, roasts several hundred thousand pounds annually, and continues producing industry-leading barista training and competition success. The company operates as independent family business while navigating competitive pressures and specialty coffee market evolution.

The cafe operations emphasize hospitality excellence alongside coffee quality, creating community gathering places serving exceptional coffee in welcoming environments. The locations balance efficient service during busy periods with genuine customer engagement and education when possible. The cafes attract diverse customers including coffee enthusiasts, students and remote workers, and casual consumers appreciating quality without requiring deep coffee knowledge.

The wholesale program supplies coffee to cafes, restaurants, hotels, and institutions across Kansas and surrounding states, with growing presence in more distant markets. The wholesale partnerships emphasize quality-focused accounts preparing coffee properly and sharing values around quality and service. The wholesale business provides revenue stability and broader reach than cafe operations alone could achieve.

The online retail and subscription services allow customers nationwide to access PT's coffee, with offerings emphasizing championship winning coffees alongside seasonal single-origin selections and core blends. The website features comprehensive coffee information and brewing guidance reflecting PT's education mission. The online business grew significantly during COVID-19 pandemic when cafe and wholesale volumes declined.

PT's market position balances Kansas regional leadership with national specialty coffee presence through championship success and education influence. The company competes through quality excellence, barista training reputation, and championship credentials rather than scale or aggressive marketing. The championship record provides differentiation in crowded markets where quality alone may not suffice.

The company's financial performance apparently supports sustainable operations while allowing continued investment in quality, education programs, and employee development. The independent family ownership means PT's can prioritize long-term values over short-term profitability pressures that corporate or venture-capital-owned companies face.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

PT's Coffee's influence on specialty coffee extends beyond Kansas to shape industry-wide barista education standards, demonstrate that geographic diversity strengthens specialty coffee, and prove that sustained excellence in training and competition creates lasting influence. The championship record establishes PT's as legendary within coffee competition communities while the education programs have trained hundreds of coffee professionals working throughout the industry.

The barista championship success challenged assumptions about necessary conditions for competition excellence, proving that premier training and success could emerge from Kansas rather than requiring coastal locations or existing coffee culture. PT's demonstrated that company culture, comprehensive training, and quality commitment mattered more than geographic location for creating competition excellence.

The education programs have influenced how specialty coffee industry approaches barista training and professional development, demonstrating that systematic education creates competitive advantage while serving broader industry improvement.
