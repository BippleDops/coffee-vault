# George Howell Coffee

## Overview

George Howell Coffee represents one of specialty coffee's most important and respected voices, a company founded by a man who has shaped American coffee culture across four decades and two distinct companies. George Howell's influence on specialty coffee extends far beyond his current roasting operation, encompassing his founding of The Coffee Connection in 1975, his pioneering work introducing varietals and estate-specific coffees to American consumers, his role in discovering and promoting Geisha coffee from Panama, and his ongoing commitment to quality excellence through the Terroir Coffee Project.

Understanding George Howell Coffee requires recognizing George Howell's unique position in specialty coffee history. While many third-wave roasters emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, Howell was advocating for quality, origin transparency, and direct producer relationships decades earlier. His work with The Coffee Connection in the 1970s and 1980s established practices that would later become third-wave hallmarks: light roasting emphasizing origin characteristics, publishing detailed origin information, sourcing coffee directly from estates and cooperatives, and treating coffee as a diverse agricultural product worthy of wine-level appreciation.

The Coffee Connection's sale to Starbucks in 1994 created a hiatus in Howell's direct coffee work, but it also provided perspective on specialty coffee's evolution and challenges. Howell observed specialty coffee's growth through the late 1990s and early 2000s while developing increasingly sophisticated understanding of coffee quality, terroir expression, and the connections between agricultural practices and cup character. When Howell returned to coffee in 2004 with George Howell Coffee, he brought decades of experience and a refined quality vision.

George Howell Coffee's founding coincided with the emergence of third-wave coffee, but Howell's approach drew from deeper historical roots. While roasters like [[Intelligentsia-Coffee]], [[Stumptown-Coffee-Roasters]], and [[Counter-Culture-Coffee]] were discovering direct trade and light roasting, Howell had been practicing these approaches for decades. This historical perspective allowed George Howell Coffee to operate as both pioneer and continuation of work begun thirty years earlier.

The company's Terroir Coffee Project, launched in 2007, represents Howell's most significant contribution to contemporary specialty coffee. The project embodies Howell's belief that exceptional coffee, like fine wine, expresses terroir—the unique combination of soil, climate, altitude, variety, and human skill that creates distinctive flavor profiles. The Terroir Project focuses exclusively on coffees that meet extraordinary quality standards and demonstrate clear terroir expression, often featuring rare varieties, experimental processing, and meticulous agricultural practices.

What distinguishes George Howell Coffee most profoundly is the integration of historical wisdom with contemporary innovation. Howell brings four decades of experience, deep relationships across coffee origins, and sophisticated understanding of quality while remaining curious and open to new approaches. The company operates with elder statesman status—respected for foundational contributions while continuing to innovate and push quality boundaries.

Howell's role in discovering and promoting Geisha coffee from Panama's Hacienda La Esmeralda represents one of specialty coffee's most significant quality revelations. In 2004, Howell encountered Geisha coffee at a cupping competition in Panama and immediately recognized its extraordinary quality—complex floral aromatics, tea-like body, distinctive flavor clarity unlike any coffee previously encountered. Howell's enthusiasm and promotion helped establish Geisha as specialty coffee's most celebrated variety, with Panamanian Geisha lots commanding record auction prices.

The company's approach to sourcing emphasizes long-term relationships with specific producers known for quality excellence and terroir expression. Howell travels to origins regularly, maintaining partnerships that often span decades. These relationships allow for collaboration on variety selection, processing innovation, and agricultural practices that enhance quality and terroir clarity. The sourcing focuses on exceptional lots rather than volume, with George Howell Coffee producing quantities measured in thousands rather than millions of pounds.

George Howell Coffee's roasting philosophy reflects Howell's decades of experience and evolving understanding of how roasting affects flavor development. The company practices light-to-medium roasting that preserves origin characteristics and terroir expression while developing sweetness and complexity. Howell approaches roasting as revealing coffee's inherent qualities rather than imposing roaster preferences, requiring exceptional green coffee and precise roast development.

The company operates cafes in Acton, Boston's Godfrey Hotel, and Newtonville, each designed to showcase coffee quality through excellent preparation and knowledgeable service. The cafes emphasize education and appreciation, treating coffee service as an opportunity to communicate quality nuances and origin stories. The spaces attract serious coffee enthusiasts willing to engage with coffee at sophisticated levels.

Today, George Howell Coffee occupies a distinctive position in specialty coffee—small enough to maintain absolute quality focus while influential enough to shape industry standards and inspire quality pursuit. The company competes not through scale or marketing sophistication but through uncompromising quality and deep expertise. Howell's status as industry pioneer and elder statesman provides credibility and influence that newer roasters cannot replicate.

Understanding George Howell Coffee requires appreciating both the company's current operations and George Howell's broader historical significance. The roaster serves as continuation of work begun in 1975, embodiment of quality-first values, and demonstration that experience and innovation can coexist productively.

## George Howell's Coffee Journey and Historical Significance

### The Coffee Connection Era (1975-1994)

George Howell's coffee journey began in 1975 when he opened The Coffee Connection in Boston's Harvard Square, at a time when American coffee culture was dominated by canned commodity coffee and the few specialty roasters focused primarily on dark-roasted blends. Howell, influenced by European coffee experiences and fascinated by coffee's agricultural diversity, envisioned creating a coffee company that would treat coffee as a diverse, terroir-driven agricultural product worthy of serious appreciation.

The Coffee Connection was revolutionary for its era, introducing practices that would become specialty coffee standards decades later. Howell sourced coffee from specific estates and cooperatives rather than regional commodity lots, published detailed origin information including altitude and processing methods, practiced lighter roasting that preserved origin characteristics, and educated consumers about coffee's complexity and diversity. These practices positioned The Coffee Connection far ahead of contemporary coffee culture.

Howell's commitment to quality and origin diversity led him to travel extensively to coffee origins, establishing direct relationships with producers and developing understanding of how agricultural practices, processing methods, and terroir affected cup quality. These origin trips, uncommon in the 1970s and 1980s, allowed Howell to source exceptional coffees while supporting producers who prioritized quality over volume.

The Coffee Connection introduced American consumers to estate-specific coffees and coffee varietals at a time when most coffee was sold simply as "Colombian" or "Kenyan" with no further specificity. Howell featured coffees from specific Guatemalan fincas, Kenyan cooperatives, and Indonesian estates, educating consumers about how origin, altitude, and processing created flavor diversity. This specificity predated the third-wave movement by two decades.

Howell's roasting philosophy emphasized preserving origin characteristics through light-to-medium roasting rather than creating uniformity through darker roasting. This approach was contrarian in an era when Peet's Coffee and early Starbucks popularized dark roasting. Howell believed that lighter roasting revealed coffee's inherent qualities—the floral notes in Kenyan coffees, the chocolate tones in Guatemalan lots, the fruit brightness in Ethiopian beans—rather than imposing roast flavors.

The Coffee Connection grew significantly through the 1980s and early 1990s, expanding to multiple Boston-area locations and developing a loyal following among quality-conscious consumers. The company's success demonstrated that enough consumers existed who would appreciate and pay for exceptional coffee prepared thoughtfully. However, growth also created tensions between quality obsession and operational demands.

The sale of The Coffee Connection to Starbucks in 1994 for a reported $23 million represented a significant moment in specialty coffee history. Starbucks, then expanding aggressively across the United States, acquired The Coffee Connection primarily for its Boston-area real estate and customer base. Howell departed the coffee industry following the sale, creating a decade-long hiatus from direct coffee work.

The Starbucks acquisition had complex implications for Howell and specialty coffee. Financially, the sale provided Howell with resources that would later support George Howell Coffee. Culturally, it removed one of specialty coffee's quality pioneers from active operations during crucial development years. The Coffee Connection's concepts and practices largely disappeared under Starbucks ownership, as the acquiring company imposed its standardized model rather than preserving The Coffee Connection's distinctive approach.

### Return to Coffee and Company Founding (2004-2007)

George Howell's return to coffee in 2004 emerged from sustained passion for quality coffee and recognition that specialty coffee's third-wave evolution created opportunities to pursue quality with even greater sophistication than The Coffee Connection era allowed. Howell had observed specialty coffee's growth during his hiatus, noting both progress in quality focus and areas where his experience and vision could contribute.

The decision to re-enter coffee reflected several considerations. Howell missed the direct engagement with coffee sourcing, roasting, and service that had defined his professional life. He recognized that his experience and relationships provided unique advantages in sourcing exceptional coffee and understanding quality. The third-wave movement's emphasis on quality, origin transparency, and direct relationships aligned with values Howell had advocated decades earlier, creating a receptive environment for his approach.

George Howell Coffee began modestly in Acton, Massachusetts, a suburban location outside Boston that provided space for roasting operations while avoiding urban real estate costs. The initial operation focused on producing exceptional coffee in small quantities, emphasizing quality over volume and depth over breadth. Howell sourced coffee from producers he had worked with for decades alongside new relationships, leveraging established trust and reputation.

The founding reflected lessons from The Coffee Connection experience. Rather than pursuing aggressive expansion, Howell focused on sustainable quality-first operations. Instead of attempting to educate mass markets, he targeted sophisticated consumers who already appreciated coffee quality. The business model emphasized profitability through premium pricing of exceptional coffee rather than volume sales of merely good coffee.

Howell's return came at an opportune moment in specialty coffee evolution. The third-wave movement had created consumer awareness of quality and origin diversity, providing a market for the exceptional coffees Howell wanted to feature. Competition judges and coffee professionals who respected Howell's historical contributions provided credibility and support. The timing allowed George Howell Coffee to build on third-wave foundations while contributing distinctive expertise and vision.

### The Panama Geisha Discovery and Terroir Project Launch (2004-2008)

George Howell's encounter with Geisha coffee from Panama's Hacienda La Esmeralda in 2004 represents one of specialty coffee's most significant quality discoveries and profoundly influenced George Howell Coffee's development. The discovery emerged from Howell's judging role at the Best of Panama coffee competition, where he encountered a coffee unlike any he had experienced in decades of professional work.

The Geisha variety, which had been grown in Panama since the 1960s but largely ignored due to low yields and unusual flavor profile, produced coffee with extraordinary floral aromatics, tea-like body, jasmine and bergamot notes, and flavor clarity that seemed to transcend coffee into a distinct beverage category. Howell immediately recognized the coffee's exceptional quality and worked to secure purchasing rights from Hacienda La Esmeralda.

Howell's enthusiasm and promotion of Panamanian Geisha helped establish the variety as specialty coffee's most celebrated and expensive coffee. His credibility as an industry pioneer and quality authority lent legitimacy to claims about Geisha's extraordinary character. The attention and prices that Geisha commanded—eventually reaching hundreds of dollars per pound at auction—demonstrated that exceptional quality could justify previously unimaginable pricing in specialty coffee.

The Geisha phenomenon influenced Howell's thinking about coffee quality, terroir, and the relationship between variety, terroir, and processing. Geisha's success demonstrated that variety selection profoundly affected flavor potential and that certain variety-terroir combinations produced transcendent results. This recognition led Howell to focus increasingly on rare varieties, specific terroir sites, and the interplay between genetics and environment.

The Terroir Coffee Project, launched in 2007, emerged from these insights about variety, terroir, and quality. Howell created the project as a framework for identifying, sourcing, and presenting coffees that demonstrated exceptional terroir expression—coffees where variety, environment, agricultural practices, and processing combined to create distinctive, unreplicable flavor profiles. The Terroir Project established criteria for inclusion that went far beyond conventional specialty coffee quality standards.

The Terroir Project criteria included exceptional cup quality (typically scoring 90+ on 100-point scale), clear terroir expression with distinctive characteristics linked to specific origin sites, meticulous agricultural practices supporting quality and sustainability, and processing excellence that preserved and enhanced inherent coffee qualities. Coffees meeting these criteria were featured in special Terroir Project offerings with comprehensive information about variety, terroir, processing, and producer practices.

The project's name and concept explicitly paralleled fine wine's terroir focus, suggesting that exceptional coffee, like exceptional wine, expressed unique characteristics of specific places and conditions. This framing elevated coffee's status and communicated that coffee quality could achieve sophistication and site-specificity comparable to wine. The terroir emphasis influenced how specialty coffee discussed quality and origin characteristics.

## Sourcing Philosophy and Producer Relationships

George Howell Coffee's sourcing approach reflects Howell's decades of origin relationships, sophisticated quality understanding, and commitment to supporting producers who prioritize quality excellence. The sourcing emphasizes long-term partnerships with specific producers known for quality innovation, meticulous agricultural practices, and willingness to collaborate on variety selection and processing experiments.

The producer relationships often span decades, predating George Howell Coffee and extending back to The Coffee Connection era. These long-term partnerships provide mutual benefits: producers gain committed buyers who pay premium prices and provide detailed feedback; Howell secures priority access to exceptional lots and opportunities to influence farming and processing decisions. The sustained relationships create trust and communication that transactional sourcing cannot replicate.

Howell's origin travels remain intensive despite his age, with regular trips to Central America, South America, East Africa, and other origins. The travels serve multiple purposes: maintaining producer relationships, evaluating new farms and washing stations, cupping harvests to assess quality, understanding how climate and market conditions affect production, and collaborating on quality improvements. The direct engagement allows Howell to understand coffee far more completely than purchasing through importers would allow.

The quality assessment emphasizes cup quality evaluated through systematic cupping protocols alongside understanding of agricultural practices, processing excellence, and terroir factors. Howell cups extensively, evaluating hundreds of samples to identify coffees meeting George Howell Coffee's standards. The cupping assesses multiple dimensions: flavor clarity and complexity, balance and structure, distinctive character linked to variety or terroir, absence of defects, and overall quality level.

The sourcing concentrates on origins and producers known for quality excellence, particularly Guatemala, Panama, Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Guatemalan relationships include partnerships with estates in Antigua, Huehuetenango, and other regions producing complex, terroir-expressive coffees. Panamanian sourcing focuses on Geisha and other distinctive varieties from high-altitude estates. Ethiopian coffees provide floral, fruit-forward profiles from specific washing stations and cooperatives. Kenyan lots offer structured acidity and complexity.

The emphasis on rare varieties and processing innovation distinguishes George Howell Coffee's sourcing from more conventional specialty roasters. Howell seeks out unusual varieties including Geisha, SL-28, Bourbon, Pacamara, and others known for distinctive flavor potential. The company features experimental processing methods including extended fermentation, anaerobic processing, and honey processing variations that create distinctive flavor profiles.

The pricing reflects quality and production costs, with George Howell Coffee paying premiums that support producer quality investments and sustainable livelihoods. While the company doesn't publish prices as systematically as some Direct Trade pioneers, Howell's reputation and long-term relationships suggest fair pricing practices. The small production volumes mean George Howell Coffee can afford to pay prices that larger roasters might find economically challenging.

## Roasting Philosophy and Quality Control

George Howell Coffee's roasting philosophy reflects Howell's decades of experience, evolving understanding of roast development, and commitment to revealing coffee's inherent qualities rather than imposing roaster preferences. The approach emphasizes light-to-medium roasting that preserves origin characteristics while developing sweetness and complexity through careful heat application and development time.

The roasting uses Loring roasters known for precise heat control and environmental efficiency. The Loring equipment allows for detailed roast profiling, with temperature and air flow adjusted to achieve specific development objectives. The roasting team, trained in Howell's philosophy and quality standards, executes roast profiles developed through extensive experimentation and cupping evaluation.

The roast development emphasizes preserving acidity structure and origin characteristics while reducing harsh or astringent qualities through proper development. Howell's approach avoids both under-roasting that leaves coffee grassy or sour and over-roasting that creates uniformity through caramelization. The target is roasting to each coffee's optimal development point where sweetness, acidity, and complexity achieve balance while preserving distinctive character.

The quality control protocols involve systematic cupping of production roasts to ensure consistency and quality maintenance. The team cups multiple samples from each production roast, evaluating against established quality standards and comparing to reference samples. Any roasts failing to meet quality expectations are rejected rather than sold, maintaining absolute quality standards even when rejection creates financial cost.

George Howell Coffee's approach to roast profiling acknowledges that different coffees require different roast profiles to achieve optimal quality. Dense, high-grown coffees might require longer development to achieve proper extraction while maintaining acidity. Lower-density coffees might need gentler heat application to avoid overdevelopment. Roast profiles are customized for each coffee based on density, moisture content, desired flavor profile, and intended brewing method.

## Current Operations and Industry Position

George Howell Coffee currently operates as a small-to-medium specialty roaster with three cafe locations, selective wholesale partnerships, and online retail serving customers nationally. The company produces tens of thousands of pounds annually—modest by commercial standards but sufficient to maintain quality focus while achieving financial sustainability.

The cafe locations serve as showcases for coffee quality and education environments where customers can experience exceptional coffee prepared properly. The Acton headquarters location includes the roasting operation alongside cafe service, allowing customers to observe roasting while experiencing finished coffee. The Boston locations bring George Howell Coffee to urban audiences seeking quality excellence and willing to pay premiums for exceptional coffee.

The wholesale program remains selective, supplying coffee to restaurants, hotels, and cafes that share George Howell Coffee's quality values and demonstrate preparation excellence. The selectivity ensures that wholesale partners present George Howell Coffee properly, maintaining quality standards and brand reputation. The limited wholesale distribution creates exclusivity while avoiding the complexity of managing extensive wholesale accounts.

The online platform features comprehensive coffee information including origin details, variety information, processing methods, flavor notes, and brewing recommendations. The educational content reflects Howell's belief that informed consumers appreciate coffee more completely.

George Howell Coffee's market position is distinctive—the company competes not through scale, aggressive marketing, or trendy positioning but through uncompromising quality and deep expertise. Howell's status as industry pioneer and elder statesman provides credibility that newer roasters cannot replicate. The Terroir Project creates differentiation through exclusive access to exceptional coffees and sophisticated quality communication.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

George Howell's influence on specialty coffee extends across four decades and encompasses foundational contributions through The Coffee Connection, quality discoveries including Panamanian Geisha promotion, the Terroir Project's quality standards elevation, and ongoing demonstration that experience and innovation can coexist productively.

The historical contributions through The Coffee Connection established practices that third-wave coffee would later adopt: origin transparency and estate-specific sourcing, light roasting preserving terroir characteristics, consumer education about coffee diversity, and direct producer relationships. Howell's 1970s-1990s work created foundations that later roasters built upon, often without recognizing historical precedents.

The Geisha discovery and promotion represents perhaps Howell's most visible contemporary contribution, establishing a variety that has profoundly influenced specialty coffee quality aspirations and economics. Geisha's success demonstrated that exceptional quality could justify extraordinary pricing, encouraged producers to experiment with rare varieties, and elevated discussions about variety selection and terroir interaction.

The Terroir Project has influenced how specialty coffee discusses quality and origin characteristics, introducing wine-industry concepts and sophisticated terroir language to coffee. The project's quality standards push specialty coffee toward greater excellence while the comprehensive origin information demonstrates how to communicate quality complexity to consumers.

Howell's commitment to quality excellence throughout his career provides a model for values-driven coffee business, demonstrating that uncompromising quality focus can sustain successful operations while maintaining industry respect and influence. The example suggests that scale and volume aren't necessary for significance and that deep expertise creates value that marketing cannot replicate.
