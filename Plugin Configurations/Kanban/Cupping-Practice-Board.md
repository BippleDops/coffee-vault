## 📋 Planned Cuppings

- [ ] **Ethiopian Processing Comparison** #cupping #comparison #planned
  - Coffees: Yirgacheffe washed, Guji natural, Sidamo honey
  - Purpose: Understand processing impact on Ethiopian terroir
  - Date: TBD
  - Participants: Solo
  - Protocol: SCA
  - Link: Create with [[Templates/Cupping Session]]

- [ ] **Kenya vs Ethiopia Comparison** #cupping #origin-comparison
  - Coffees: Kenya AA, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (both washed)
  - Purpose: Compare East African profiles
  - Learn: Acidity types, body differences
  - Date: TBD

- [ ] **Blind Cupping Practice** #cupping #blind #training
  - Coffees: 4 different origins (helper to label)
  - Purpose: Practice blind identification
  - Goal: Correctly identify 3/4 origins
  - Date: Monthly practice


## 🏃 This Week

- [ ] **Colombian Roast Level Study** #cupping #in-progress #active
  - Coffees: Same Colombian bean at 3 roast levels
  - Status: Sourcing light and dark versions
  - Have: Medium roast
  - Need: Light roast, dark roast from roaster
  - Date: This weekend

- [ ] **Aeropress Parameter Testing** #cupping #experimentation
  - Variables: Steep time (1min, 2min, 3min)
  - Constant: Same bean, same grind, same temp
  - Purpose: Find optimal steep time
  - Sessions: 3 back-to-back
  - Record: Detailed tasting notes for each
