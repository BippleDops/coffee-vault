- Unpleasant aftertaste

**Root Causes**:
1. Over-extraction (extracted too much from beans)
2. Water temperature too high
3. Grind too fine
4. Brew time too long
5. Too much agitation

**Solutions** (in order of impact):

1. **Reduce Water Temperature** (-2-5°C)
   - Try 91°C instead of 94°C
   - Biggest impact for bitterness

2. **Grind Coarser** (2-3 clicks)
   - Reduces extraction rate
   - Shortens brew time naturally

3. **Reduce Brew Time**
   - Pour faster
   - Less pours (reduce from 5 to 3)

4. **Less Agitation**
   - Gentler stirring
   - No swirl after bloom

5. **Check Coffee Age**
   - Very stale coffee can taste bitter
   - Fresh beans (1-4 weeks off roast) better

**Quick Fix**: Lower temperature to 90°C, grind 2 clicks coarser. Test.

### Problem: Coffee Tastes Sour/Acidic

**Symptoms**:
- Sharp, unpleasant acidity
- Makes you pucker
- Tastes incomplete/unfinished
- Watery body

**Root Causes**:
1. Under-extraction (didn't extract enough)
2. Water temperature too low
3. Grind too coarse
4. Brew time too short
5. Insufficient contact time

**Solutions** (in order of impact):

1. **Increase Water Temperature** (+2-5°C)
   - Try 95-96°C instead of 93°C
   - Biggest impact for sourness

2. **Grind Finer** (2-3 clicks)
   - Increases extraction rate
   - Naturally extends brew time

3. **Extend Brew Time**
   - Pour slower
   - More pours for controlled extraction

4. **More Agitation**
   - Stir after bloom

## 🎓 EXTRACTION FUNDAMENTALS

**Understanding Why Problems Happen**:

**Extraction** = pulling solubles from coffee into water

**Under-Extraction** (<18% extraction):
- Tastes sour, weak, incomplete
- Didn't extract enough from beans
- Fix: Increase extraction (hotter, finer, longer, more agitation)

**Ideal Extraction** (19-22% extraction):
- Balanced, sweet, complex
- Got the good stuff from beans
- Goal: Stay in this range

**Over-Extraction** (>23% extraction):
- Tastes bitter, harsh, astringent
- Extracted too much (including bad stuff)
- Fix: Decrease extraction (cooler, coarser, shorter, less agitation)

**The Variables**:
1. **Temperature**: Higher = more extraction
2. **Grind**: Finer = more extraction
3. **Time**: Longer = more extraction
4. **Agitation**: More = more extraction
5. **Dose**: More coffee = potentially more extraction

**Fixing Taste Issues**:
- Bitter = over-extracted → reduce extraction
- Sour = under-extracted → increase extraction
- Adjust variables accordingly

## 📝 Notes

Pour-over troubleshooting is systematic problem-solving. Most issues trace to extraction level (under or over). Understanding extraction principles lets you diagnose and fix problems logically rather than randomly adjusting variables.

**The Iterative Process**:
1. Identify problem (taste/timing/physical)
2. Diagnose root cause (under/over-extraction, technique, equipment)
3. Implement solution (change ONE variable)
4. Test results (brew again)
5. Iterate (adjust based on results)

**Most Common Issues** (in order):
1. **Inconsistent measurements** - Buy a scale!
2. **Wrong grind size** - Most common taste issue
3. **Wrong temperature** - Second most common taste issue
4. **Stale coffee** - Fresh beans matter more than technique
5. **Poor water quality** - Filtered water is essential

**The 80/20 Rule**:
80% of pour-over problems are solved by:
1. Weighing coffee and water
2. Controlling temperature
3. Adjusting grind size appropriately
4. Using fresh beans (1-4 weeks off roast)
5. Using filtered water

Master these five things before worrying about advanced technique.

**Remember**: Even experts don't nail every brew. Pour-over has variables. Goal is consistency, not perfection. If 8/10 brews are good, you're doing great.
