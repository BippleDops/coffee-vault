- **Light-Medium**: Good (Full City-, adjust temperature down)
- **Nordic/Scandinavian Roast**: Perfect (ultra-light development)
- **Omni Roast**: Excellent (designed for filter and espresso)

**Target Roast Development**:
- Short development time (60-90 seconds after first crack)
- High charge temperature, fast roast
- Preserves origin character and acidity
- Roast date: 7-21 days off roast (optimal)
- Avoid: Under 5 days (too gassy), Over 30 days (losing complexity)

**Roast Profile Characteristics**:
- Light brown color (Agtron 70-85 for whole bean)
- Dense bean structure (high altitude preferred)
- Pronounced acidity preservation
- Minimal caramelization (preserves floral compounds)
- Bright, grassy aroma when ground

### Works Exceptionally Well With

**Perfect Matches**:
- Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Kochere (washed) - Bergamot, jasmine, lemon
- Ethiopian Guji Hambela (natural) - Blueberry, rose, strawberry
- Panama Geisha Hacienda La Esmeralda - Jasmine, tropical fruit, tea-like
- Kenya Kirinyaga AA (washed) - Blackcurrant, floral, wine-like acidity
- Ethiopia Sidamo Bensa (natural) - Peach, lavender, black tea

**Excellent Matches**:

- Guatemala Huehuetenango (washed) - Jasmine, chocolate, citrus

**Good Matches**:
- Any light roast with floral tasting notes
- Competition coffees (85+ cupping score)
- Micro-lot selections
- Single-origin showcases

### Avoid With

**Poor Matches**:
- Dark roasts (Full City+, Vienna, French) - Will over-extract, bitter
- Italian roast styles - Completely wrong profile
- Brazilian naturals (low acidity) - Better with immersion methods
- Robusta beans - Not designed for this profile
- Aged coffee (over 3 months off roast) - Lost complexity
- Pre-ground coffee - Stale before brewing

**Why These Don't Work**:
- Dark roasts: Soluble compounds already degraded, will extract bitter oils
- Low-acid origins: Recipe designed for brightness, won't showcase strengths
- Stale coffee: Floral compounds most volatile, first to degrade
- Pre-ground: Aromatics escape within minutes of grinding

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Pre-Brewing Preparation (2-3 minutes before brewing)

**Step 1: Water Preparation**
- Fill gooseneck kettle with filtered water
- Set temperature to 96°C (will drop to 94°C)
- Turn on kettle and allow to reach temperature
- Kettle will hold temperature until ready

**Step 2: Bean Weighing**
- Place small container on scale
- Tare scale to zero
- Weigh exactly 15.0g coffee beans
- Use whole beans (never pre-ground)

**Step 3: Grinding**
- Ensure grinder is clean and dry
- Set grind size to medium-fine (20-22 clicks Comandante)
- Pour beans into grinder
- Grind immediately before brewing (oxidation starts instantly)
- Grind should be uniform, consistent particle size
- Check for grinder retention (tap out all coffee)

**Step 4: Filter Preparation**
- Place V60 dripper on vessel or cup
- Insert V60 filter (fold seam if applicable)
- Ensure filter sits flush against V60 walls

**Step 5: Preheat and Rinse**
- Pour hot water through filter (50-100g)
- This rinses paper taste and preheats V60
- Swirl water in vessel to preheat it
- Discard rinse water completely
- Ensure V60 and vessel are hot to touch

**Step 6: Final Setup**
- Place preheated V60 and vessel on scale
- Tare scale to zero
- Add ground coffee to filter
- Gently shake V60 to level coffee bed
- Create small well in center with finger (optional)
- Have timer ready to start
- Confirm kettle at 94°C (±1°C)

### Brewing Process (3:00 total time)

**Phase 1: Bloom (0:00 - 0:45)**

**0:00 - Start Timer**
- Start timer simultaneously with first water contact
- Begin pouring water in center of coffee bed
- Use slow, controlled circular motion
- Pour spiraling outward from center
- Avoid pouring on filter (stay 1cm from edge)

**0:00 - 0:15 - Bloom Pour**
- Pour to 40g total (2.7x coffee dose)
- Complete pour by 0:15
- All coffee grounds should be saturated
- Bloom should be even, no dry spots

**0:15 - 0:20 - Gentle Agitation**
- Gentle swirl of V60 (pick up and rotate)
- OR use spoon to gently stir edges to center (5-10 stirs)
- Goal: Ensure complete saturation, no dry pockets
- Coffee will bubble and degas (especially fresh coffee)

**0:20 - 0:45 - Bloom Rest**
- Allow coffee to bloom undisturbed
- CO2 releases, creating foam
- Fresh coffee (7-14 days) will bloom vigorously
- Older coffee blooms less dramatically
- Watch for even bubbling across surface
- Bed may rise slightly, this is normal

**Bloom Science**: CO2 trapped in beans from roasting creates barrier to water. Bloom releases CO2, allowing water to access soluble compounds in subsequent pours. Adequate blooming critical for even extraction.

**Phase 2: First Main Pour (0:45 - 1:15)**

**0:45 - Begin First Pour**
- Kettle at 94°C
- Begin slow, controlled pour
- Start in center, spiral outward
- Maintain steady pour rate (3-4g per second)

**Pour Technique**:
- Gooseneck spout 5-8cm above coffee bed
- Slow, controlled spiral motion
- Pour from center → outer edge → center
- Steady concentric circles
- Avoid disturbing coffee on filter walls
- Maintain steady stream (pencil-thin width)

**0:45 - 1:05 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 130g total (+90g from bloom)
- Maintain steady pour rate
- Coffee bed should rise evenly
- Aim for consistent turbulence (gentle agitation)
- No fast channels or uneven flow

**1:05 - 1:15 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 130g by 1:15
- Allow water to draw down slightly
- Coffee bed should be relatively flat
- Water level dropping toward coffee surface

**Phase 3: Second Main Pour (1:15 - 1:45)**

**1:15 - Begin Second Pour**
- Start second pour at 1:15
- Same technique as first pour
- Center spiral pattern
- Maintain 3-4g per second rate

**1:15 - 1:35 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 200g total (+70g from previous)
- Steady, controlled spiral
- Coffee bed rises again
- Even turbulence across surface

**1:35 - 1:45 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 200g by 1:45
- Allow brief drawdown
- Prepare for final pour

**Phase 4: Final Pour (1:45 - 2:15)**

**1:45 - Begin Final Pour**
- Start third pour at 1:45
- Slightly slower, more gentle
- Focus on center to maintain flat bed

**1:45 - 2:05 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 250g total (+50g from previous)
- Slower, more delicate pour
- Avoid disturbing coffee bed edges

**2:05 - 2:15 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 250g by 2:15
- Final water added
- Coffee bed should be flat
- No high-and-dry coffee on walls

**Phase 5: Drawdown (2:15 - 3:00)**

**2:15 - 3:00 - Final Drawdown**
- No more water added
- Water drains through coffee bed
- Do not disturb or agitate
- Drawdown should be steady, not stalling

**Visual Cues During Drawdown**:
- Water level gradually lowers
- Coffee bed settles flat
- Minimal residue on filter walls
- Even, level final bed (indicates even extraction)

**2:45 - 3:00 - Final Moments**
- Last water draining through
- Target completion: 3:00 (±15 seconds acceptable)
- Coffee bed should be flat with minimal high-and-dry
- All water drained

**3:00 - Completion**
- Remove V60 from vessel
- Inspect coffee bed:
  - Flat bed = good extraction
  - Domed or uneven = channeling occurred
  - High-and-dry on walls = pouring too aggressively
- Discard filter and spent coffee

**Phase 6: Serving**

**Immediately After Brewing**:
- Gentle swirl of brewed coffee in vessel
- Swirling integrates any settling
- Smell the aroma (floral, fruit, complex)
- Pour into preheated cup

**Drinking Window**:
- **Too Hot** (0-2 min): Aromatics strong, flavors muted
- **Optimal** (3-10 min): Full flavor complexity emerges
- **Cooling** (10-20 min): Different flavors appear as temperature drops
- **Cold** (20+ min): New characteristics, but losing vitality

**Tasting Notes**:
- First sip: Aromatics, acidity, initial impressions
- Second sip: Body, sweetness, texture
- Third sip: Complexity, finish, aftertaste
- Allow coffee to cool, taste evolution

## 🎯 Pour Technique Mastery

### The Perfect Pour

**Gooseneck Control**:
- **Height**: 5-8cm above coffee surface (too high = splashing, too low = stirring)
- **Angle**: Kettle at 45° angle to vertical
- **Stream Width**: Pencil-thin, consistent diameter
- **Flow Rate**: 3-4g per second (steady, controlled)
- **Movement**: Smooth, continuous spiral motion

**Spiral Pattern**:
- Start in center of coffee bed
- Spiral outward in concentric circles
- Outer limit: 1cm from filter wall
- Return to center
- Repeat throughout pour
- Goal: Even saturation across entire bed

**Common Pour Mistakes**:
- **Pouring Too Fast**: Creates channeling, uneven extraction
- **Pouring on Walls**: Water bypasses coffee (underextraction)
- **Pouring Too High**: Disturbs coffee bed, creates turbulence
- **Inconsistent Rate**: Some areas over-extracted, others under
- **Center-Only Pour**: Edges underextracted, channeling risk

**Pour Practice Drill**:
- Practice pouring into empty V60
- Aim for consistent pour rate
- Master spiral pattern
- Build muscle memory
- Track 30-second pours (should be ~90-100g at 3g/sec)

### Agitation Philosophy

**Why Agitation Matters**:
- Ensures even saturation during bloom
- Prevents channeling
- Promotes uniform extraction
- Breaks up clumps

**Minimal Agitation Approach** (This Recipe):
- Gentle swirl after bloom only
- Pours provide adequate agitation
- Goal: Clarity and clean cup

**Alternative: Aggressive Agitation**:
- Stir after each pour
- Creates more turbulence
- Increases extraction and body
- Risk: Over-extraction, muddiness
- Best for: Under-extracting coffees

**When to Adjust Agitation**:
- **Increase**: Coffee tastes weak, sour, underextracted
- **Decrease**: Coffee tastes muddy, harsh, over-extracted
- **Standard**: Gentle bloom swirl (this recipe)

## 📊 Extraction Science and Theory

### Understanding Extraction

**What is Extraction?**
- Extraction: Percentage of coffee's mass dissolved into water
- Target: 18-22% for balanced cup
- Under 18%: Sour, weak, underdeveloped
- Over 22%: Bitter, harsh, astringent
- Optimal zone: 19-21% for most coffees

**Extraction Timeline**:
- **0-30 seconds**: Acids, fruity esters (bright, sour)
- **30-90 seconds**: Sugars, caramels (sweet, balanced)
- **90-180 seconds**: Bitter compounds, heavy oils (body, bitterness)
- Bloom critical for even extraction of all compounds

**Factors Affecting Extraction**:
1. **Grind Size**: Smaller = more surface area = faster extraction
2. **Temperature**: Hotter = faster extraction, more compounds
3. **Time**: Longer contact = more extraction
4. **Agitation**: More turbulence = faster, more even extraction
5. **Water Quality**: Minerals act as solvents, affect extraction

### Light Roast Extraction Challenges

**Why Light Roasts Are Harder**:
- Denser bean structure (less roast development)
- Cell structure more intact (harder for water to penetrate)
- Acids more prominent (can taste sour if underextracted)
- Require higher extraction (20-22%) to taste balanced
- Narrower optimal extraction window

**Solutions in This Recipe**:
- Medium-fine grind (more surface area)
- Higher temperature (94°C for better penetration)
- Adequate contact time (3:00 total)
- Gentle agitation (improves saturation without over-extraction)
- Proper bloom (releases CO2, allows water access)

### Floral Compound Chemistry

**What Creates Floral Notes**:
- **Linalool**: Lavender, floral sweetness
- **Geraniol**: Rose-like, floral
- **Beta-damascenone**: Fruity-floral, honey
- **Jasmine lactone**: Jasmine, peach
- These are volatile aromatics, extremely delicate

**Preservation Strategies**:
- **Lower temperature**: High heat degrades aromatics (94°C optimal)
- **Fresh coffee**: Aromatics fade rapidly (7-21 days peak)
- **Minimal oxidation**: Grind immediately before brewing
- **Clean extraction**: Avoid over-extraction (bitter masks floral)
- **Proper storage**: Airtight, cool, dark

### Water Chemistry Impact

**Ideal Water Profile for Floral Coffees**:
- **Total Hardness**: 50-100 ppm (as CaCO3)
- **Calcium**: 30-50 ppm (extracts sweet, fruity notes)
- **Magnesium**: 15-25 ppm (extracts floral, bright notes)
- **Alkalinity**: 40-70 ppm (buffers acids)
- **TDS**: 100 ppm ideal

**Water Too Soft** (<50 ppm):
- Under-extraction
- Flat, lifeless cup
- Weak body
- Solution: Add minerals (Third Wave Water)

**Water Too Hard** (>200 ppm):
- Over-extraction
- Chalky, mineral taste
- Dulled flavors
- Solution: Use filtered or distilled water with remineralization

### Temperature and Solubility

**Temperature's Role**:
- Higher temperature = higher solubility of compounds
- Light roasts need 92-96°C (higher than dark roasts at 88-92°C)
- Each 1°C change affects extraction significantly

**Heat Loss During Brewing**:
- Kettle to slurry: ~2-3°C drop
- During bloom: ~3-5°C drop
- During brewing: Additional 2-3°C drop
- Final slurry temperature: ~85-88°C at finish

**Temperature Stability Strategies**:
- Preheat V60 and vessel thoroughly
- Start with slightly higher kettle temp (96°C → becomes 94°C)
- Brew in warm environment
- Avoid cold drafts
- Use ceramic V60 (best heat retention)

### Particle Size Distribution

**Grind Consistency Matters**:
- **Uniform grind**: Even extraction, balanced cup
- **Uneven grind**: Fines over-extract (bitter), boulders under-extract (sour)
- Quality grinder essential for light roasts

**Ideal Particle Distribution**:
- Narrow bell curve centered on 600-800 microns
- Minimal fines (<10% under 400 microns)
- Minimal boulders (<10% over 1000 microns)
- Achieved by quality burr grinders

**Grinder Type Impact**:
- **Conical burrs**: Wider distribution, more fines
- **Flat burrs**: Narrower distribution, more uniformity
- **Hand grinders**: Often excellent uniformity (Comandante, 1Zpresso)
- **Blade grinders**: Terrible uniformity, unusable for this recipe

## 💡 Expert Tips and Advanced Techniques

### Pro Tips from Competition Baristas

**Tip 1: The Perfect Bloom**
- Bloom weight should be 2.5-3x coffee dose
- 45-second bloom ideal for most light roasts
- Fresh coffee (7-14 days): May need 60-second bloom
- Older coffee (21-30 days): 30-40 second bloom sufficient
- Gentle swirl, don't stir aggressively

**Tip 2: Pour from the Wrist**
- Control comes from wrist rotation, not arm movement
- Stabilize elbow, move only wrist and hand
- Creates smooth, consistent spiral
- Reduces fatigue in longer brews

**Tip 3: The "Tetsu Tap"**
- After bloom, gently tap V60 on counter
- Settles grounds, removes air pockets
- Creates flatter bed for even extraction
- Named after Tetsu Kasuya (2016 World Brewers Cup Champion)

**Tip 4: Temperature Consistency**
- Use same kettle position throughout brew
- Don't set down kettle (loses heat)
- Keep kettle on base between pours
- Monitor temperature if kettle has display

**Tip 5: The Flat Bed Finish**
- Flat bed at finish = even extraction
- Domed bed = channeling occurred
- High-and-dry on walls = pouring too hard on edges
- Adjust technique based on bed shape

**Tip 6: Taste, Measure, Adjust**
- Taste is ultimate judge
- TDS meter validates but doesn't replace tasting
- Take notes every brew
- Make one change at a time
- Track results over 3-5 brews before changing again

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Dialing In New Coffee**:
1. **First Brew**: Standard recipe (15g, 250g, 94°C, medium-fine)
2. **Taste and Assess**:
   - Too sour → Temperature up OR grind finer
   - Too bitter → Temperature down OR grind coarser
   - Good but weak → Finer grind, same temperature
   - Good but strong → Coarser grind or higher ratio
3. **Second Brew**: Adjust ONE variable
4. **Compare**: Better, worse, or different?
5. **Iterate**: Continue until optimal

**The Triangle Method** (Comparing Grind Sizes):
- Brew three cups: coarse, medium, fine (all other variables same)
- Taste side-by-side
- Identify optimal grind zone
- Refine from there

**Time Laddering** (Competition Technique):
- Brew multiple cups with different total times (2:30, 2:45, 3:00, 3:15)
- Adjust grind to hit each time
- Taste to find optimal time for this coffee
- Reveals how coffee responds to extraction

### Seasonal and Environmental Adjustments

**Summer Brewing** (Hot, Humid):
- Grind may need to be slightly coarser (humidity affects grind)
- Coffee may degas faster (fresher = more volatile)
- Consider iced method
- Keep coffee in coolest storage

**Winter Brewing** (Cold, Dry):
- Preheat equipment more thoroughly
- May need higher temperature (heat loss to environment)
- Static in grinder (use RDT - Ross Droplet Technique: spritz beans with water)
- Coffee stays fresh longer (cooler storage)

**High Altitude** (>1500m elevation):
- Water boils at lower temperature
- May need pressure brewing methods instead
- Adjust temperature expectations
- Coffee may brew faster (lower air pressure)

**Hard Water Regions**:
- Invest in water filtration or remineralization
- Use Third Wave Water, Perfect Coffee Water, or DIY water
- Hard water ruins floral notes
- Consider bypass water for dilution

### Storage and Freshness Optimization

**Optimal Coffee Storage**:
- **Container**: Airtight, opaque, one-way valve
- **Location**: Cool, dark, consistent temperature
- **Not Refrigerator**: Condensation and odor absorption
- **Not Freezer**: Only for long-term (>1 month) storage

**Freshness Timeline**:
- **Days 1-4**: Too fresh, excess CO2, hard to extract
- **Days 5-14**: Peak freshness, optimal brewing
- **Days 15-21**: Excellent, slight aromatics fade
- **Days 22-30**: Good, noticeable degradation
- **Days 31+**: Declining, losing complexity

**Batch Size Strategy**:
- Buy in quantities consumable in 2-3 weeks
- 250-350g bags ideal for home brewing
- Track roast date, buy fresh

### Cleaning and Maintenance
