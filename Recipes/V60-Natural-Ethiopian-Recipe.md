## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps (4:6 Method Adaptation)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 97°C (will drop to 95°C)
   - Weigh 20g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium-fine (21 clicks Comandante)
   - Rinse V60 filter thoroughly with hot water
   - Preheat V60 and server
   - Tare scale with V60 and coffee

2. **Bloom - First Pour** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Add 50g water (2.5x dose) in circular motion
   - Ensure all grounds saturated
   - Gentle swirl for even saturation
   - Natural process creates more gas - expect vigorous bloom
   - Wait until 0:45

3. **Second Pour** (0:45 - 1:30)
   - Pour to 120g total (70g water added)
   - Slow spiral pour from center outward
   - Control sweetness/acidity balance
   - Wait until 1:30

4. **Third Pour** (1:30 - 2:10)
   - Pour to 200g total (80g water added)
   - Same spiral technique
   - Complete pour by 2:10
   - Wait for drawdown

5. **Fourth Pour** (2:10 - 2:50)
   - Pour to 260g total (60g water added)
   - Maintain spiral pattern
   - Complete pour by 2:50

6. **Final Pour** (2:50 - 3:20)
   - Pour to 300g total (40g water added)
   - Center pour to maintain flat bed
   - Complete pour by 3:20

7. **Drawdown** (3:20 - 3:30)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 3:30
   - Bed should be flat
   - Natural process may take slightly longer

8. **Finish** (3:30)
   - Remove V60
   - Gentle swirl of brewed coffee
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Slow, deliberate spiral maintaining even flow
**Agitation Method**: Gentle swirl after bloom, minimal during pours
**Pour Velocity**: Slow and steady (aim for ~7-9g/second)
**Target Bed Appearance**: Flat, even bed with some fines visible (normal for naturals)

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.40-1.50%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 21-23%
- **Target Strength**: Medium to full-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Explosive fruit, berry, wine-like, floral, complex

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 3:15-3:45
- Flat coffee bed at finish
- Minimal channeling
- Intense fruity aroma
- Complex, clean cup with fruit bomb character

**Signs of Success**:
- Vigorous bloom with CO2 release
- Steady drawdown
- Flat bed at completion
- Intense berry/fruit aroma during brewing
- Clean cup with explosive fruit flavors

**Signs of Failure**:
- Fast drawdown (<3:00) - grind finer
- Slow drawdown (>4:00) - grind coarser
- Muddy/dirty cup - check grind quality, ensure filter rinse
- Muted fruit - increase temperature or finer grind
- Over-fermented taste - beans may be defective

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If finishing before 3:15 → grind finer
- If still draining after 3:45 → grind coarser
- If fruit notes muted → increase temperature to 96°C
- If cup is muddy → ensure thorough filter rinse

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**Variations**:
- **Fruit Bomb Version**: Increase temp to 96°C, use 1:14 ratio
- **Clarity Version**: Increase ratio to 1:16, reduce agitation
- **Iced Version**: Use 1:13 ratio, brew over ice (incredible for naturals)
- **Quick 3-Pour Version**: (bloom + 2 large pours)

**When to Use Variations**:
- Fruit bomb: For maximum fruit intensity
- Clarity: When natural is too intense or funky
- Iced: Summer days - natural Ethiopians make incredible iced coffee
- Quick: Morning rush but still good results

**Alternative Ratios**:
- 1:14 (intense, fruit bomb)
- 1:15 (standard, balanced)
- 1:16 (lighter, more clarity)

**Alternative Temperatures**:
- 93°C (for medium roasts or to reduce intensity)
- 95°C (standard)
- 96°C (for very light roasts or maximum extraction)

**Winter Version**: Use 1:14 ratio, 96°C for warming, intense fruit flavors

**Summer Version**: Use 1:16 ratio or brew iced version - natural Ethiopians excel iced

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **High temperature critical** - naturals need 95-96°C for full extraction
- Natural process coffees have more chaff - rinse filter thoroughly
- Expect vigorous bloom - naturals retain more CO2
- Grind slightly finer than washed coffees
- Longer brew time (3:30-3:45) is normal and desirable
- Natural process creates more body and sweetness
- Allow coffee to cool to 60°C to taste full complexity
- Natural Ethiopians can be polarizing - some love the fruit bomb

**Common Mistakes**:
- Using water too cool (<93°C) - mutes fruit notes
- Grinding too coarse - underextracts, loses complexity
- Rushing the brew - needs time for full extraction
- Not rinsing filter - creates papery taste that masks fruit
- Over-agitating - can create muddy cup
- Expecting washed coffee profile - naturals are different!

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Muted Fruit**: Increase temperature, grind finer, extend brew time
- **Too Funky/Fermented**: Decrease ratio to 1:16, reduce temperature
- **Too Intense**: Increase ratio to 1:16, slightly coarser grind
- **Lacks Clarity**: Reduce agitation, ensure filter rinse
- **Lacks Body**: Decrease ratio to 1:14, grind slightly finer

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Muddy Cup**: Ensure thorough filter rinse, check grind consistency
- **Fermented Taste**: May be bean quality issue, try lower temp
- **Thin Body**: Grind finer, increase temperature
- **Muted Flavors**: Increase temperature significantly (96°C)

## 📝 Notes

This V60 recipe is specifically designed for natural process Ethiopian coffees, which are known for explosive fruit flavors, berry notes, and wine-like complexity. Natural process requires higher temperatures and specific techniques to fully extract the fruit character.

Natural processed coffees are dried with the cherry still on the bean, creating intense fruit fermentation flavors. This recipe uses the 4:6 method adaptation to control sweetness while maximizing fruit extraction.

Works exceptionally well with:
- Ethiopian natural Guji (best match - blueberry bomb)
- Ethiopian natural Sidamo (excellent - strawberry, tropical fruit)
- Ethiopian natural Yirgacheffe (excellent - floral, berry)
- Ethiopian natural Harrar (very good - wine-like, complex)

**Key Insight**: Natural Ethiopians are polarizing. Some people love the intense fruit bomb character, others find it too much. This recipe balances intensity with clarity.

**Iced Coffee Note**: Natural Ethiopian iced coffee is phenomenal - use 1:13 ratio and brew directly over ice for incredible summer drinks.
