## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps (Inverted Bypass Method)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water, precisely cool to 90°C
   - Weigh exactly 30g coffee beans
   - Grind to fine (18-20 clicks Comandante)
   - Invert AeroPress (plunger at mark 4)
   - Add ground coffee
   - Prepare 100g bypass water (90°C) in second vessel
   - Tare scale with inverted AeroPress

2. **Add Water Phase 1** (0:00 - 0:10)
   - Start timer immediately
   - Add 100g water quickly
   - Pour aggressively to saturate
   - Complete by 0:10

3. **Aggressive Stir** (0:10 - 0:20)
   - Stir vigorously 20 times
   - Ensure complete, aggressive saturation
   - More agitation than standard recipe
   - Complete by 0:20

4. **Add Water Phase 2** (0:20 - 0:30)
   - Add remaining 100g water (200g total)
   - Pour quickly
   - One more quick stir (5 times)
   - Complete by 0:30

5. **Screw Cap and Flip** (0:30 - 0:35)
   - Rinse filter, screw on cap firmly
   - Place mug on top
   - Flip confidently
   - Place on scale
   - Complete by 0:35

6. **Wait** (0:35 - 0:45)
   - Let pressure build
   - Coffee settles slightly
   - Wait until 0:45 exactly

7. **Press** (0:45 - 1:30)
   - Press gently but steadily
   - Take 45 seconds to complete press
   - Target ~200g output (some loss to absorption)
   - Stop at hiss
   - Complete by 1:30

8. **Bypass** (1:30)
   - Immediately add 100g bypass water (90°C)
   - Swirl to combine
   - This dilutes concentrate to proper strength
   - Final output: ~300g

9. **Serve**
   - Remove AeroPress
   - Final swirl
   - Measure TDS if available
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Inversion**: Critical for controlled extraction time
**Aggressive Agitation**: Much more than standard - extracts complexity
**Two-Phase Water**: Ensures saturation then extraction
**Fine Grind**: Finer than standard for higher extraction
**Bypass Method**: Concentrate then dilute for clarity
**Precise Timing**: Seconds matter in competition brewing
**Temperature**: Lower temp (90°C) reduces astringency with fine grind

**Competition Philosophy**:
- Precision and repeatability
- Showcasing coffee's best qualities
- Aggressive extraction with clarity
- Every parameter intentional

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.40-1.55% (after bypass)
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 22-24% (high extraction)
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied with exceptional clarity
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Complex, clean, showcases coffee's unique character

**Success Criteria**:
- Precise timing (±5 seconds)
- Aggressive but clean extraction
- High clarity despite fine grind
- Complex flavor profile
- Repeatable results

**Signs of Success**:
- Aggressive extraction without bitterness
- Exceptional clarity and complexity
- Clean cup despite fine grind
- Coffee's unique character shines
- Judges/friends impressed
- Repeatable results batch to batch

**Signs of Failure**:
- Bitter/astringent - over-extracted, lower temp or coarser
- Muddy - grind too fine, reduce agitation
- Weak - not enough extraction, finer grind or more agitation
- Inconsistent - technique not repeatable

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If bitter → lower temp to 85-88°C
- If weak → finer grind or more agitation
- If muddy → less agitation or coarser grind
- If inconsistent → focus on timing precision

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**WAC-Inspired Variations**:
- **2024 Style**: Standard position, medium grind, gentle technique
- **2023 Style**: Inverted, multiple small pours, long steep
- **2022 Style**: Standard, fine grind, aggressive pour
- **Bypass vs Direct**: Concentrate+dilute vs direct strength
- **Cold Start**: Room temp water, extended steep (weird but works)

**Championship Wisdom**:
Every year's WAC winner uses completely different recipe. There's no "correct" competition method. This recipe represents common successful elements.

**When to Use Variations**:
- Different coffee characteristics require different approaches
- Experiment to find what showcases YOUR coffee best
- Competition is about showcasing specific coffee, not universal method

**Alternative Techniques**:
- **Standard position**: Less risky, slightly different profile
- **Metal filter**: More body, less clarity
- **Multiple filters**: Cleaner cup (some comp winners use 2-3 filters)
- **Prismo**: Higher pressure, espresso-style

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Practice with cheaper beans first** - dial in technique before using expensive coffee
- Precision is critical - 0.1g scales, precise timing
- Take detailed notes - repeatability is key
- Aggressive agitation extracts complexity (but risks over-extraction)
- Bypass method provides safety - can adjust strength after brewing
- Competition coffees are different - what wins competitions may not be daily drinker
- Don't be intimidated - it's still AeroPress, just more precise
- TDS meter helps dial in (target 1.40-1.55%)
- Lower temperature (90°C) compensates for fine grind and agitation

**Competition Reality**:
World AeroPress Championship winners use WILDLY different recipes each year. Examples:
- Some use standard position, others inverted
- Some use coarse grinds, others espresso-fine
- Some use boiling water, others room temperature
- Some steep 30 seconds, others 3 minutes

**The Point**: There's no single "competition recipe." Success is showcasing YOUR specific coffee's best qualities.

**Common Mistakes**:
- Copying competition recipe without understanding coffee context
- Over-extracting with fine grind and high temp (reduce temp!)
- Inconsistent technique - precision matters
- Using mediocre coffee - competition methods showcase quality, not create it
- Ignoring TDS - measure to dial in
- Afraid to experiment - competitions reward innovation

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Bitter**: Lower temp significantly (85-88°C), reduce agitation
- **Too Weak**: Finer grind, more agitation, ensure full extraction
- **Muddy**: Reduce agitation, slightly coarser grind
- **Lacks Complexity**: Increase agitation, ensure adequate extraction
- **Astringent**: Lower temp, less agitation

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Over-extracted**: Too fine, too much agitation, or temp too high
- **Under-extracted**: Grind finer or increase agitation
- **Inconsistent**: Focus on timing precision and repeatable technique
- **Muddy**: Fine grind with excessive agitation - reduce one

## 📝 Notes

The World AeroPress Championship (WAC) has produced wildly different winning recipes since 2008. This isn't because there's one "correct" method - it's because different coffees require different approaches. This recipe incorporates common elements from successful competition brewing.

**Competition Context**:
WAC competitors receive specific coffee and have limited time to develop recipe showcasing that coffee's best qualities. They're not finding universal best method - they're optimizing for specific coffee. Your goals may be different.

**Why This Recipe Works**:
1. **Fine grind + low temp**: Extracts complexity without astringency
2. **Aggressive agitation**: Ensures full extraction and complexity
3. **Bypass method**: Safety valve - adjust strength after brewing
4. **Precision**: Repeatability is critical for competition
5. **Inverted**: Complete control over steep time

**Famously Different WAC Winners**:
- **2024**: Standard position, gentle technique, 93°C
- **2023**: Inverted, multiple pours, complex timing
- **2022**: Fine grind, aggressive pour, short time
- **2019**: Room temperature water (!)
- **2016**: Ultra-coarse grind, long steep

**The Lesson**: Don't blindly follow competition recipes. Understand principles:
- Know your coffee (origin, processing, roast level)
- Choose parameters to showcase coffee's strengths
- Precision and repeatability matter
- Measure results (TDS meter)
- Iterate and improve

**Should You Brew Like This Daily?**
Probably not. This is precision brewing for showcasing exceptional coffee. For daily brewing, standard AeroPress methods are more practical. But understanding competition techniques improves all your brewing.

**Cost Reality**:
Competition-grade coffees cost $25-50+ per 12oz. This method makes sense for exceptional beans you want to showcase, not daily brewing.

**Best Use Cases**:
- Exceptional coffees (85+ cupping score)
- Competition preparation
- Showcasing expensive beans to guests
- Learning precision brewing
- Coffee geek experimentation
- Understanding extraction principles

**Not ideal for**:
- Daily brewing (too much effort)
- Commercial-grade coffee (waste of effort)
- When you want simple, consistent results

**The Meta-Lesson**:
Competitions teach us that there's no single "best" brewing method. Success is matching technique to specific coffee's characteristics. This is coffee brewing's most important lesson.
