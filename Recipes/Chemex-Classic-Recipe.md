## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 96°C (will drop to 94°C)
   - Weigh 42g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium-coarse
   - Open Chemex filter (3 layers on spout side)
   - Place filter in Chemex
   - **Rinse filter thoroughly** with hot water (200-300g)
   - Discard rinse water
   - Add ground coffee to filter
   - Tare scale

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Pour 100g water (2.4x dose) in gentle spiral
   - Ensure complete saturation
   - Gentle swirl of Chemex to ensure even saturation
   - Wait until 0:45
   - Chemex bloom is beautiful to watch

3. **First Pour** (0:45 - 1:30)
   - Pour to 300g total (200g water added)
   - Slow, controlled spiral from center outward
   - Maintain steady, slow pour
   - Avoid pouring directly on filter
   - Complete by 1:30

4. **Second Pour** (1:30 - 2:30)
   - Pour to 500g total (200g water added)
   - Same slow, controlled spiral
   - Chemex requires patience - slow pours
   - Complete by 2:30

5. **Third Pour** (2:30 - 3:30)
   - Pour to 700g total (200g water added)
   - Maintain gentle, spiral pour
   - Complete by 3:30
   - This is your final pour

6. **Drawdown** (3:30 - 4:30)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 4:00-4:30
   - Should see beautiful flat bed
   - Chemex drawdown is slower due to thick filters
   - This slow drawdown creates clarity

7. **Finish** (4:00-4:30)
   - Remove filter and coffee
   - Swirl Chemex gently
   - Pour into cups
   - Enjoy the clean, elegant cup

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Very slow, controlled spiral (slower than V60)
**Agitation Method**: Minimal - gentle swirl after bloom
**Pour Velocity**: Slow (aim for ~6-8g/second)
**Filter Handling**: 3 layers on spout side (critical for even flow)
**Target Bed Appearance**: Flat bed with minimal wall residue

**Chemex Characteristics**:
- Slower brewing than V60 (thick filters)
- Requires coarser grind than V60
- Creates uniquely clean cup (filters remove oils)
- Elegant, beautiful brewing process

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Filter rinse is critical** - removes paper taste and preheats
- Use 3 layers of filter on spout side for even flow
- Grind coarser than V60 - Chemex filters are thicker
- Pour slowly - Chemex rewards patience
- Avoid pouring directly on filter - reduces channeling
- Batch brewing is Chemex's strength - makes great coffee for groups
- The slow drawdown creates the clarity - embrace it
- Beautiful brewing process - enjoy the ritual
- Chemex is perfect for entertaining guests

**Common Mistakes**:
- Grinding too fine - causes clogging and over-extraction
- Not rinsing filter - papery taste ruins clean cup
- Pouring too fast - disrupts bed, reduces clarity
- Filter orientation wrong - uneven flow
- Skipping preheat - temperature loss during brew
- Using wrong filters - cheap filters don't match Chemex design

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak/Thin**: Increase dose to 45g, grind finer
- **Too Bitter**: Lower temperature, coarser grind
- **Too Slow (>5:30)**: Grind coarser, check for clogging
- **Too Fast (<3:30)**: Grind finer, increase dose
- **Lacks Clarity**: Ensure filter rinse, slower pours

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Clogged Filter**: Grind coarser, ensure no excessive fines
- **Papery Taste**: Rinse filter more thoroughly (200-300g water)
- **Channeling**: Avoid pouring on filter, improve distribution
- **Bitter**: Lower temperature or coarser grind
- **Weak**: More coffee or finer grind

## 📝 Notes

The Chemex is an icon of specialty coffee and industrial design. Its thick, bonded filters create a uniquely clean cup by removing oils and fine particles, resulting in tea-like clarity and brightness. This makes it perfect for light, bright coffees where you want to showcase delicate flavors.

**Chemex Philosophy**:
Dr. Peter Schlumbohm designed the Chemex in 1941 combining function and aesthetics. It's both a brewing device and a beautiful carafe. The hourglass shape and wooden collar are iconic. The thick filters are essential to the Chemex experience - they create the characteristic clean, bright cup.

**Chemex vs Other Pour-Overs**:
- **vs V60**: Cleaner cup, less body, easier technique, better for batches
- **vs Kalita**: Similar batch capability, Chemex has more clarity, less body
- **vs French Press**: Opposite profiles - Chemex is clean, FP is full-bodied

**Best Use Cases**:
- Batch brewing (3-4 cups) - Chemex excels here
- Entertaining guests - beautiful brewing process
- Light, bright coffees - showcases delicate flavors
- When you want maximum clarity
- Weekend morning ritual

**Perfect Coffees for Chemex**:
- Ethiopian washed (absolute best - floral, tea-like)
- Kenyan washed (excellent - clarity enhances complexity)
- Central American washed (excellent - balanced)
- Any coffee where clarity and brightness are desired

**Design Note**: The Chemex is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It's one of the few coffee brewers that's also an art object.
