## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 97°C (high temp critical)
   - Weigh 20g coffee beans
   - Weigh 100g ice into server
   - Grind to medium-fine (22 clicks Comandante)
   - Rinse V60 filter with hot water (discard rinse water)
   - Place V60 on server with ice
   - Add ground coffee to V60
   - Tare scale

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Add 50g hot water (2.5x dose) in circular motion
   - Ensure all grounds saturated
   - Gentle swirl
   - Wait until 0:45
   - (Ice begins melting during bloom)

3. **First Pour** (0:45 - 1:15)
   - Pour to 130g total hot water (80g added)
   - Slow, controlled spiral
   - Maintain steady pour
   - Complete by 1:15
   - (Coffee drips directly onto ice)

4. **Second Pour** (1:15 - 1:45)
   - Pour to 200g total hot water (70g added)
   - Same spiral technique
   - Complete by 1:45

5. **Drawdown** (1:45 - 2:30)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Coffee drips onto ice and chills instantly
   - Target completion: 2:30
   - Ice should be mostly melted

6. **Finish** (2:30)
   - Remove V60
   - Swirl server to ensure even cooling
   - Add fresh ice to serving glass if desired
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Slow, controlled spiral
**Agitation Method**: Gentle swirl after bloom
**Pour Velocity**: Steady (aim for ~8-10g/second)
**Ice Quality**: Use filtered water ice for best results
**Target Bed Appearance**: Flat bed

**Critical Points**:
- High temperature (96°C) compensates for ice dilution
- Coffee must drip directly onto ice for flash chilling
- Ice amount is critical to final strength
- Brewing finishes with ice mostly melted

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.30-1.40% (after ice melts)
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 20-22%
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied iced coffee
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Bright, fruity, aromatic, no oxidation

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 2:15-2:45
- Ice mostly melted by end
- Final volume ~300ml
- Bright, aromatic cup
- No oxidized/flat flavors

**Signs of Success**:
- Ice melts during brewing
- Final volume correct (~300ml)
- Bright, aromatic coffee
- Clean, crisp flavors
- No bitterness
- Preserved fruit notes

**Signs of Failure**:
- Too much ice remaining - brew was too fast or ice too much
- Too little liquid - not enough ice or too much evaporation
- Flat/oxidized taste - temperature too low or brew too slow
- Weak taste - not enough coffee or too much ice
- Bitter taste - grind too fine or temperature too high

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If too weak → reduce ice to 80g, maintain 200g water
- If too strong → increase ice to 120g, reduce water to 180g
- If flat/lifeless → increase temperature to 97°C
- If bitter → grind slightly coarser

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **High temperature critical** - compensates for ice dilution
- Use filtered water for both brewing and ice
- Weigh ice accurately - it determines final strength
- Grind slightly finer than hot V60 for same extraction
- Flash brew preserves aromatics better than cold brew
- Serve immediately for best results
- Ethiopian naturals make phenomenal flash brew iced coffee
- Clean, bright coffees work better than dark, heavy coffees
- This method is MUCH better than brewing hot and refrigerating
- Ice quality matters - use fresh, clean ice

**Common Mistakes**:
- Using water too cool (<95°C) - creates weak, underextracted iced coffee
- Too much ice - creates overly diluted coffee
- Too little ice - creates too-strong, hot coffee
- Grinding same as hot coffee - leads to underextraction
- Using low-quality ice - affects taste
- Brewing hot coffee and refrigerating instead (oxidizes)

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: Reduce ice to 80g OR increase coffee to 22g
- **Too Strong**: Increase ice to 120g OR reduce coffee to 18g
- **Lacks Brightness**: Increase temperature to 97°C
- **Bitter**: Grind slightly coarser
- **Flat/Dull**: Increase temperature, ensure flash cooling

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Ice not melting**: Water too cool or brew too fast - increase temp
- **Too much ice remaining**: Reduce ice amount or brew hotter
- **Weak coffee**: Reduce ice or increase coffee dose
- **Oxidized taste**: Ensure coffee drips directly onto ice (flash cooling critical)

## 📝 Notes

Flash brew iced coffee (brewing hot directly over ice) is superior to cold brew for bright, aromatic coffees. The hot brewing extracts full complexity and aromatics, while instant chilling onto ice prevents oxidation and preserves bright flavors.

This method is traditional in Japan and has become the standard for high-quality iced coffee in specialty coffee. It's faster than cold brew (minutes vs. hours) and produces brighter, more complex iced coffee.

**Why Flash Brew Is Better**:
- Preserves bright acidity and aromatics
- Extracts full complexity (hot water)
- Prevents oxidation (instant chilling)
- Much faster than cold brew
- More versatile - works with any coffee
- Cleaner, brighter flavors

**Best Coffees for Flash Brew Iced**:
- Ethiopian natural (absolute best - fruit bomb)
- Ethiopian washed (excellent - floral, bright)
- Kenya (excellent - complexity preserved)
- Central American (very good - balanced)
- Any bright, fruity coffee

**When to Use Cold Brew Instead**:
- Want concentrated coffee for mixing
- Making large batches in advance
- Prefer smooth, low-acid profile
- Don't have precision brewing equipment

**Summer Essential**: This recipe is a game-changer for summer coffee drinking. Ethiopian naturals brewed this way create incredibly refreshing, fruit-forward iced coffee that's far superior to cold brew.
