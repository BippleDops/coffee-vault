## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation**
   - Weigh 25g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium (drip coffee grind)
   - Fill lower chamber with 375g hot water (save time)
   - Attach filter to upper chamber
   - Hook/chain should hang into lower chamber
   - Ensure filter is centered and secure
   - Place upper chamber in lower chamber (but not sealed yet)
   - Light heat source

2. **Heat Lower Chamber** (0:00 - 2:00)
   - Heat water in lower chamber to boiling
   - This takes 2-3 minutes
   - Meanwhile prepare coffee
   - When water approaches boiling, proceed to next step
   - Don't insert upper chamber until water is hot

3. **Insert Upper Chamber** (2:00)
   - When water is steaming heavily
   - Insert upper chamber firmly to create seal
   - Water will begin rising into upper chamber
   - This is the vacuum/pressure magic
   - Wait for most water to rise
   - Lower chamber should have ~50ml water remaining

4. **Add Coffee** (2:30)
   - Once water fully risen, add all ground coffee
   - Pour gently into upper chamber
   - Coffee will float on surface initially
   - Don't stir yet

5. **Start Timer and Stir** (2:30)
   - Start 1:00-1:30 timer
   - After 10 seconds, stir gently
   - Ensure all coffee is saturated
   - Use gentle swirl motion
   - One thorough stir is enough
   - Crust will sink

6. **Steep** (2:30 - 3:30/4:00)
   - Let coffee steep for full time
   - Water should maintain gentle movement (not violent boil)
   - If boiling too hard, reduce heat slightly
   - If water drops back down, increase heat
   - Watch for proper agitation level
   - Complete steep time

7. **Remove from Heat** (3:30/4:00)
   - After steep time complete, remove from heat
   - Turn off/remove heat source completely
   - Vacuum will begin pulling coffee down
   - This is the dramatic part

8. **Drawdown** (Watch the Theater)
   - As lower chamber cools, pressure drops
   - Vacuum pulls coffee through filter into lower chamber
   - Should take 1-2 minutes
   - Coffee slowly descends
   - Creates "dome" of grounds in upper chamber
   - When fully descended, remove upper chamber

9. **Serve**
   - Remove upper chamber carefully (hot!)
   - Swirl lower chamber gently
   - Pour into cups
   - Enjoy ultra-clean, bright coffee
   - Marvel at the science

### Technique Notes

**Vacuum Science**: Pressure from boiling pushes water up, cooling creates vacuum that pulls coffee down
**Heat Control**: Maintain gentle boil (not violent), adjust as needed
**Stirring**: One gentle but thorough stir, don't over-agitate
**Filter**: Cloth filters more body, paper filters more clarity
**Seal**: Upper chamber must seal well for proper vacuum
**Drawdown**: Should be smooth and complete (1-2 minutes)

**Safety Notes**:
- Handle with care - very hot glass
- Ensure stable setup - siphons are top-heavy
- Use proper heat source - open flame under glass is safe if designed for it
- Don't force upper chamber - should seal naturally

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Start with hot water** in lower chamber (saves 2-3 minutes)
- Ensure proper seal between chambers (critical)
- Maintain gentle boil (not violent) during steep
- One thorough stir is usually enough
- Cloth filters provide more body, paper more clarity
- Remove from heat decisively when time's up
- The theatrical presentation is part of the appeal
- Perfect for impressing coffee-geek guests
- Ultra-clean cup - cleaner than V60, Chemex, anything
- Takes practice but not as difficult as it looks

**Common Mistakes**:
- Heat too high - violent boiling disturbs extraction
- Poor seal - water won't rise or drops back
- Dirty filter - slow drawdown or off flavors
- Not removing from heat cleanly - continues extracting
- Over-stirring - can lead to over-extraction
- Using lower chamber water measurement (some water doesn't rise)

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Water Won't Rise**: Check seal, increase heat significantly
- **Too Weak**: Longer steep time, finer grind, more coffee
- **Too Bitter**: Shorter steep time, coarser grind, less heat
- **Slow Drawdown**: Clean or replace filter
- **Incomplete Drawdown**: Check seal, ensure proper cooling

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Water Won't Rise**: Seal not tight - ensure upper chamber inserted firmly
- **Violent Boiling**: Heat too high - reduce immediately
- **Water Drops During Steep**: Heat too low - increase heat
- **Slow/No Drawdown**: Filter clogged - clean cloth filter or replace paper
- **Bitter**: Steep too long or too much agitation
- **Weak**: Steep too short or grind too coarse

## 📝 Notes

The siphon (vacuum pot) is coffee brewing as theater and science. Invented in the 1830s, it uses vapor pressure and vacuum to create immersion brewing with ultra-clean filtration. The result is exceptionally clean, bright coffee with all the complexity of pour-over but the body of immersion.

**Siphon History**:
The vacuum coffee maker was invented in the 1830s in Germany. It became popular in Japan in the 20th century, where meticulous preparation elevated it to art form. Many Japanese specialty cafés still specialize in siphon coffee, with preparation taking 10+ minutes per cup.

**The Science**:
1. **Rising**: Heat creates vapor pressure in lower chamber, pushing water up
2. **Brewing**: Coffee steeps via full immersion in upper chamber
3. **Falling**: Removing heat causes cooling, creating vacuum in lower chamber
4. **Filtration**: Vacuum pulls coffee through filter, leaving grounds above

**Why Siphon Coffee Is Special**:
- **Ultra-clean**: Cloth/paper filtration at end creates exceptional clarity
- **Full immersion**: Complete, even extraction like French Press
- **Consistent temperature**: Boiling water maintains stable temp during steep
- **Theatrical**: The most visually impressive brewing method
- **Complexity**: Captures nuance like pour-over, body like immersion

**Siphon vs Other Methods**:
- **vs V60**: Similar clarity, more body, more theatrical
- **vs French Press**: Much cleaner, less body, way more impressive
- **vs Chemex**: Similar cleanliness, more body, totally different aesthetic
- **vs AeroPress**: Similar principles, siphon is automated/pressure-driven

**Best Use Cases**:
- Weekend coffee ritual (perfect)
- Impressing guests (excellent - it's a show)
- Showcasing exceptional light roasts (ideal)
- When you have time and want theater
- Coffee geek gatherings
- Not practical for daily brewing

**Japanese Siphon Culture**:
In Japan, siphon coffee is elevated to art. Baristas train for years to perfect technique. Some cafés use only siphon, with each cup prepared individually over 10+ minutes. The slow, meticulous preparation is part of the experience. This is coffee as meditation and performance.

**Equipment Maintenance**:
- **Cloth filters**: Wash immediately after use, store in water in fridge
- **Replace cloth**: Every 20-30 uses or when flavor degrades
- **Paper filters**: Single use, very clean cup
- **Glass cleaning**: Use mild detergent, avoid thermal shock
- **Storage**: Disassemble when storing to avoid seal issues

**Cost Reality**:
Siphon setup costs $60-200+ (quality matters for glass). Butane burners are $20-40. This is not budget brewing, but it's spectacular.

**Perfect for**: Light roast, complex, bright coffees where you want to showcase every nuance in ultra-clean cup while putting on a show.

**Not ideal for**: Daily quick brewing, very dark roasts, simple coffees, when you're in a hurry.
