## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 97°C (will drop to 95°C)
   - Weigh 18g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium-fine (22 clicks Comandante)
   - Rinse V60 filter thoroughly with hot water
   - Preheat V60 and server extensively
   - Tare scale with V60 and coffee

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Add 50g water (2.8x dose) in circular motion
   - Ensure complete saturation (dig gently if needed)
   - Gentle swirl to ensure even saturation
   - Kenya coffees bloom vigorously due to freshness
   - Wait until 0:45

3. **First Pour** (0:45 - 1:15)
   - Pour to 150g total (100g water added)
   - Very slow, controlled spiral from center outward
   - Maintain steady pour height (5-7cm)
   - Pour rate: ~8g/second
   - Complete pour by 1:15

4. **Second Pour** (1:15 - 1:45)
   - Pour to 250g total (100g water added)
   - Same slow, controlled spiral technique
   - Maintain consistency
   - Complete pour by 1:45

5. **Final Pour** (1:45 - 2:15)
   - Pour to 300g total (50g water added)
   - Center pour to maintain flat bed
   - Very gentle pour
   - Complete pour by 2:15

6. **Drawdown** (2:15 - 2:45)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 2:45
   - Bed should be perfectly flat
   - Minimal residue on walls
   - If draining too fast/slow, adjust grind

7. **Finish** (2:45)
   - Remove V60
   - Gentle swirl of brewed coffee
   - Allow to cool to 65°C before first sip
   - Kenya's complexity develops as it cools

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Slow, deliberate spiral with exceptional control
**Agitation Method**: Minimal - gentle swirl after bloom only
**Pour Velocity**: Slow and steady (aim for ~8g/second)
**Target Bed Appearance**: Perfectly flat bed, minimal wall residue

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.35-1.45%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 20-22%
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied with bright acidity
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Black currant, tomato sweetness, wine-like, citrus, phosphoric acidity

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 2:30-3:00
- Perfectly flat coffee bed
- No channeling
- Bright, complex aroma
- Clean cup with characteristic Kenya profile

**Signs of Success**:
- Vigorous bloom
- Steady, even drawdown
- Perfectly flat bed at completion
- Intense black currant aroma
- Clean cup with bright acidity and savory-sweet complexity

**Signs of Failure**:
- Fast drawdown (<2:30) - grind finer
- Slow drawdown (>3:15) - grind coarser
- Channeling visible - improve distribution
- Muted acidity - increase temperature or grind finer
- Harsh/astringent - decrease temperature or coarser grind

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If finishing before 2:30 → grind finer
- If still draining after 3:00 → grind coarser
- If acidity is muted → increase temp to 96°C
- If too astringent → decrease temp to 93°C

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**Variations**:
- **Maximum Clarity Version**: Increase ratio to 1:18, minimal agitation
- **Intensity Version**: Decrease ratio to 1:16, add gentle stir after bloom
- **Competition Version**: Use exact 20g dose, 333g water, 96°C
- **Iced Version**: Use 1:15 ratio, brew over ice

**When to Use Variations**:
- Maximum clarity: For delicate, tea-like Kenyas
- Intensity: When you want more body and strength
- Competition: For showcasing exceptional lots
- Iced: Summer - Kenya makes phenomenal iced coffee

**Alternative Ratios**:
- 1:16 (stronger, more intensity)
- 1:16.7 (standard, balanced)
- 1:18 (lighter, maximum clarity)

**Alternative Temperatures**:
- 93°C (for very light roasts to reduce astringency)
- 95°C (standard)
- 96°C (for maximum extraction and complexity)

**Winter Version**: Use 1:16 ratio, 96°C for warming, intense brew

**Summer Version**: Use 1:18 ratio or iced version - Kenya excels iced

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **High temperature critical** - Kenyas need 95-96°C for full extraction
- Use filtered water with proper mineral content (50-150 TDS)
- Grind immediately before brewing - Kenyas lose complexity quickly
- Slow, controlled pours are essential for clarity
- Minimal agitation preserves characteristic acidity
- Allow coffee to cool to 65°C before first sip
- Kenya's complexity develops significantly as it cools
- Black currant and tomato notes are characteristic - not defects
- Freshness critical - Kenya coffees best within 3 weeks of roast

**Common Mistakes**:
- Pouring too aggressively - disturbs bed, reduces clarity
- Using water too cool (<93°C) - underextracts, mutes complexity
- Over-agitating - can mute delicate acidity
- Drinking too hot - can't taste complexity until it cools
- Skipping thorough preheat - temperature loss during brew
- Using old coffee - Kenya loses character quickly

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Muted Acidity**: Increase temperature to 96°C, grind slightly finer
- **Too Astringent/Harsh**: Decrease temperature to 93°C, coarser grind
- **Lacks Complexity**: Ensure fresh coffee, increase temperature
- **Lacks Body**: Decrease ratio to 1:16, increase dose
- **Too Intense**: Increase ratio to 1:18, slightly coarser

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Channeling**: Improve grind distribution, WDT technique
- **Astringency**: Lower temperature, coarser grind
- **Flat/Muted**: Check roast date, increase temperature
- **Overly Acidic**: Slightly coarser grind, lower temp to 93°C

## 📝 Notes

This V60 recipe is specifically designed for Kenyan AA washed coffees, which are known for their bright acidity, black currant notes, and unique savory-sweet tomato-like character. Kenya's double fermentation washing process creates exceptional clarity and complexity.

Kenyan coffees are among the world's most distinctive and complex. The SL28 and SL34 varieties combined with double fermentation washing create a flavor profile unlike any other origin.

Works exceptionally well with:
- Kenya AA Nyeri (best match - black currant, tomato)
- Kenya AA Kirinyaga (excellent - citrus, wine-like)
- Kenya AA Kiambu (excellent - complex, bright)
- Kenya AB (very good - similar profile, slightly smaller beans)

**Key Insights**:
- High temperature (95-96°C) is critical for full extraction
- Minimal agitation preserves characteristic acidity
- Allow coffee to cool - complexity develops significantly
- Black currant and tomato notes are positive characteristics
- Freshness is critical - Kenya loses character after 3-4 weeks

**Water Quality**: Kenyan coffees are particularly sensitive to water quality. Use filtered water with moderate mineral content (50-150 TDS). Too soft water will create flat, lifeless cups. Too hard water will increase astringency.
