## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation (3-4 minutes before brewing)

**Step 1: Water Heating**
- Fill gooseneck kettle with 800-900g filtered water (more than needed)
- Set temperature to 95°C (will drop to 93°C when ready)
- Turn on and wait for target temperature
- Kettle should hold temperature

**Step 2: Coffee Weighing**
- Place container on scale, tare
- Weigh 42g whole coffee beans
- Verify accuracy (±0.5g)
- Use fresh beans (7-28 days off roast)

**Step 3: Grinding**
- Clean grinder of any old coffee
- Set grind to medium-coarse (26-28 clicks Comandante)
- Grind beans immediately before brewing
- Check consistency: uniform particle size
- Tap grinder to release all grounds

**Step 4: Filter Preparation**
- Open Chemex bonded filter (square style)
- Fold filter into cone: fold in half, then quarters
- Open into cone with three layers on one side
- Place in Chemex with three-layer side facing spout
- Ensure filter sits flat against walls, fully covering

**Step 5: Rinse and Preheat**
- Pour 200-300g hot water through filter
- This rinses paper taste and preheats Chemex
- Swirl water to preheat entire glass vessel
- Lift filter slightly, discard rinse water through spout
- Ensure Chemex is warm to touch

**Step 6: Final Setup**
- Place preheated Chemex on scale
- Ensure filter sits properly (three layers on spout side)
- Tare scale to zero
- Add 42g ground coffee to filter
- Gently shake Chemex to level coffee bed
- Create small well in center with finger (helps blooming)
- Prepare timer
- Verify kettle at 93°C (±1°C)

### Brewing Process (4:00-4:30 total)

**Phase 1: Bloom (0:00 - 0:45)**

**0:00 - Start**
- Start timer as first water touches coffee
- Begin pouring in center of coffee bed
- Slow, controlled circular pour
- Spiral outward from center to edges

**0:00 - 0:20 - Bloom Pour**
- Pour to 110g total (2.6x coffee dose)
- Ensure all grounds saturated (no dry spots)
- Stay ~1cm away from filter edges
- Complete pour by 0:20

**0:20 - 0:25 - Gentle Agitation**
- Pick up Chemex, gentle swirl (circular motion)
- OR use spoon to gently fold edges to center
- Ensure complete, even saturation
- Coffee will bloom, bubble, degas

**0:25 - 0:45 - Bloom Rest**
- Set down Chemex, do not disturb
- CO2 releases, creating foam/bubbles
- Fresh coffee (7-14 days) blooms vigorously
- Older coffee (21-28 days) blooms less
- Entire bed should be evenly saturated

**Bloom Chemistry**: Medium roasts have less CO2 than light roasts but still benefit from bloom. CO2 creates hydrophobic barrier; bloom removes it, allowing even extraction.

**Phase 2: First Main Pour (0:45 - 1:30)**

**0:45 - Start First Pour**
- Water should be 93°C
- Begin slow, controlled pour in center
- Steady spiral from center outward
- Pour rate: ~4-5g per second

**Pour Technique**:
- Gooseneck 6-10cm above coffee surface
- Slow, steady, continuous pour
- Concentric circles from center to outer edge
- Stay 1cm from filter wall
- Maintain pencil-width stream
- Avoid disturbing coffee bed aggressively

**0:45 - 1:20 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 350g total (+240g from bloom)
- Steady, controlled spiral motion
- Coffee bed rises evenly
- Chemex chamber fills partially
- Even turbulence across surface

**1:20 - 1:30 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 350g by 1:30
- Stop pouring
- Allow water to draw down

**1:30 - 1:45 - Drawdown Pause**
- Water drains through coffee bed
- Level drops toward coffee surface
- This pause allows even extraction
- Bed should remain flat

**Phase 3: Second Main Pour (1:45 - 2:30)**

**1:45 - Start Second Pour**
- Begin second pour at 1:45
- Same technique: center spiral outward
- Maintain ~4-5g per second

**1:45 - 2:20 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 550g total (+200g from previous)
- Steady spiral motion
- Coffee bed rises again
- Chamber fills more

**2:20 - 2:30 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 550g by 2:30
- Stop pouring
- Allow brief drawdown

**2:30 - 3:00 - Drawdown Pause**
- Water drains through bed
- Longer pause than first
- Allows controlled extraction
- Bed settling flat

**Phase 4: Final Pour (3:00 - 3:45)**

**3:00 - Start Final Pour**
- Begin third pour at 3:00
- Slightly slower, gentler than previous
- Focus on center, maintain flat bed

**3:00 - 3:35 - Active Pouring**
- Pour to 700g total (+150g from previous)
- Slower, more delicate pour
- Avoid disturbing edges
- Final water addition

**3:35 - 3:45 - Complete Pour**
- Finish at 700g by 3:45
- All water added
- Coffee bed should be flat and even
- No high-and-dry coffee on filter walls

**Phase 5: Final Drawdown (3:45 - 4:30)**

**3:45 - 4:30 - Complete Drainage**
- No more water added
- Water drains through thick bonded filter
- Chemex's thick filter = slower drawdown than V60
- Should be steady, not stalling
- Target completion: 4:15 (±15 seconds acceptable)

**Visual Cues**:
- Water level gradually decreasing
- Coffee bed settling flat
- Minimal residue on filter
- Even color across bed
- Clear, clean brewed coffee visible in chamber

**4:15-4:30 - Final Moments**
- Last water dripping through
- Bed should be completely flat
- Minimal coffee on filter walls
- All water drained

**4:30 - Completion**
- Remove filter and spent grounds
- Inspect coffee bed:
  - Flat = excellent extraction
  - Domed/uneven = channeling occurred
  - High-and-dry = poured too hard on walls
- Discard filter and grounds

**Phase 6: Serving**

**Immediately After Brewing**:
- Gentle swirl of Chemex to integrate coffee
- Smell the aroma from spout (chocolate, nuts, fruit)
- Pour into preheated cups
- Serve immediately or place Chemex lid

**Serving Options**:
- Serve directly from Chemex (beautiful presentation)
- Decant into insulated carafe (maintains temperature longer)
- Pour into individual cups (personal service)

**Ideal Drinking Temperature**:
- **0-3 min**: Too hot, aromatics strong, flavors muted
- **3-12 min**: Optimal - full flavor development
- **12-25 min**: Cooling, new flavors emerge
- **25+ min**: Room temp, different but interesting profile

**Tasting Sequence**:
- First sip: Aroma, initial impression, acidity
- Second sip: Sweetness, body, balance
- Third sip: Complexity, finish, aftertaste
- As cools: Flavor evolution, new notes appearing

## 🎯 Chemex Technique Mastery

### Understanding Chemex's Unique Characteristics

**Why Chemex is Different**:
- **Thick Bonded Filter**: 20-30% thicker than standard, removes oils and fines
- **Hourglass Shape**: Creates optimal flow rate, controls extraction
- **Glass Construction**: Non-reactive, doesn't affect flavor
- **Air Channel**: Spout-side design allows air escape, prevents vacuum
- **Large Capacity**: Designed for batch brewing (2-4 cups optimal)

**Chemex Advantages**:
- Ultra-clean cup (cleaner than V60, French Press, AeroPress)
- Beautiful presentation (brew and serve in same vessel)
- Consistent results (less technique-dependent than V60)
- Excellent for sharing (batch brewing strength)
- Highlights clarity and brightness

**Chemex Trade-offs**:
- Less body than immersion methods (filters out oils)
- Can over-filter delicate flavors (very light roasts)
- Slower than other methods (4-5 minutes)
- Not ideal for single servings (minimum 2 cups)
- Requires specific bonded filters (not universal)

### Pouring Technique for Chemex

**Chemex Pour Differences from V60**:
- **Slower Pour**: Thicker filter needs slower pour rate (4-5g/sec vs 3-4g/sec for V60)
- **Higher Pour Point**: Can pour from 8-12cm (thicker filter handles it)
- **Less Agitation**: Filter provides plenty of contact time, less agitation needed
- **Longer Pauses**: Allows drawdown between pours
- **Coarser Grind**: Compensates for longer contact time

**The Perfect Chemex Pour**:
- Steady, controlled spiral motion
- Start center, spiral outward
- Return to center, repeat
- Maintain consistent pour rate
- Stay 1cm from filter edge
- Pencil-width water stream
- Height: 6-10cm above coffee surface

**Common Pouring Mistakes**:
- **Pouring Too Fast**: Creates channeling, uneven extraction
- **Pouring on Filter Edge**: Water bypasses coffee
- **Inconsistent Pour Rate**: Some areas over-extract, others under
- **Too Much Agitation**: Can create muddy cup
- **Skipping Bloom**: Poor saturation, uneven extraction

### Filter Folding Mastery

**Square Filter Folding**:
1. Filter is circular when opened
2. Fold exactly in half (semicircle)
3. Fold in half again (quarter circle / cone shape)
4. Open cone: three layers one side, one layer other side
5. Three-layer side faces spout (allows air channel)
6. Smooth filter against Chemex walls

**Half-Moon Pre-Folded Filters**:
- Already shaped, just open into cone
- Three-layer side marked or obvious
- Place three-layer side toward spout
- Easier for beginners

**Filter Rinsing Importance**:
- Removes paper taste (especially natural filters)
- Preheats Chemex glass
- Ensures filter seals against walls
- Use 200-300g hot water
- Discard all rinse water before brewing

**What Makes Medium Roast Special**:
- Balanced development (acidity + sweetness + body)
- Caramelization present but not dominant
- Origin character still present
- Less acidic than light roasts
- Less bitter than dark roasts
- Most approachable for general audiences

**Extraction Needs**:
- **Target**: 19-21% extraction
- **Temperature**: 92-94°C (moderate)
- **Grind**: Medium-coarse (balanced)
- **Time**: 4-5 minutes (adequate contact)
- **Ratio**: 1:16-17 (balanced strength)

### Chemex Filter Science

**Why Bonded Filters are Different**:
- 20-30% thicker than standard paper filters
- Three-layer construction (two layers one side, one layer other)
- Removes coffee oils (diterpenes like cafestol, kahweol)
- Removes fine particles (sediment)
- Creates ultra-clean cup

**What Gets Filtered Out**:
- Coffee oils (reduces body, increases clarity)
- Fine particles (prevents muddiness)
- Some aromatic compounds (very volatile)
- Some dissolved solids (lower TDS than immersion)

**What Passes Through**:
- Dissolved solids (flavor compounds)
- Acids (brightness)
- Sugars (sweetness)
- Water-soluble compounds
- Caffeine

**Health Consideration**: Paper filtered coffee removes cafestol and kahweol, which can raise cholesterol. Chemex particularly effective at this.

### Water Chemistry for Chemex

**Optimal Water Profile**:
- **TDS**: 75-150 ppm
- **Hardness**: 60-120 ppm
- **Alkalinity**: 40-80 ppm
- **pH**: 6.5-7.5
- **Calcium**: 30-70 ppm
- **Magnesium**: 10-30 ppm

**Why Water Matters**:
- Water is 98%+ of final cup
- Minerals extract flavor compounds
- Alkalinity buffers acidity
- Too soft: flat, underextracted
- Too hard: harsh, overextracted

## 💡 Expert Tips

### Pro Tips from Specialty Coffee Baristas

**Tip 1: The Three-Layer Rule**
- Always place three-layer side toward spout
- Creates air channel, prevents vacuum
- Allows proper flow rate
- Critical for consistent brewing

**Tip 2: Preheat Thoroughly**
- Use 200-300g rinse water (not just 50-100g)
- Chemex is large, needs more heat
- Swirl rinse water to heat walls
- Warm Chemex prevents temperature drop

**Tip 3: Batch Size Matters**
- Chemex performs best at 2-4 cups (30-60g coffee)
- Single servings better with V60 or AeroPress
- Too little coffee = fast, underextracted
- Sweet spot: 40-50g coffee

**Tip 4: The Pause is Intentional**
- Pauses between pours allow controlled extraction
- Different from continuous pour methods
- Gives thick filter time to drain
- Creates cleaner cup

**Tip 5: Grind Coarser Than V60**
- Chemex needs coarser grind due to:
  - Longer contact time (4-5 min vs 3 min)
  - Thicker filter (more resistance)
  - Larger batch size (more coffee bed depth)
- Typically 3-5 clicks coarser than V60

**Tip 6: Embrace the Clarity**
- Chemex designed for clean, clear cups
- Don't fight the method - use appropriate coffees
- Best for balanced, clean origins
- Not ideal for heavy-bodied or funky coffees

### Advanced Techniques

**Temperature Stepping** (Experimental):
- Bloom at 90°C (gentle extraction)
- Main pours at 94°C (full extraction)
- Theory: Gentle bloom, aggressive main extraction
- Results: Mixed, some prefer it

**Single Large Pour** (Quick Method):
- Bloom: 110g, 0:45
- Single continuous pour: 110g → 700g over 2:00-2:30
- Total time: 3:30-4:00
- Trade-off: Faster but less control

**Bypass Method**:
- Brew concentrate (42g:600g = 1:14.3)
- Add 100g bypass water after brewing
- Final ratio: 1:16.7
- Benefit: Adjustable strength, safety net
