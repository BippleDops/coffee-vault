## 📋 Recipe Overview

**Description**: A foolproof cold brew concentrate recipe designed to produce smooth, sweet, low-acid coffee that's incredibly forgiving and consistently delicious. This long-steep, cold-water immersion method creates a concentrated coffee extract with 60-70% less acidity than hot-brewed coffee, featuring chocolate, caramel, and smooth sweetness without bitterness. The concentrate is diluted 1:1 with water, milk, or ice for serving, making it economical and versatile for home use.

**Recipe Philosophy**: Cold brewing extracts coffee compounds differently than hot brewing. Cold water extracts fewer bitter oils and acidic compounds while emphasizing chocolate, caramel, and sweet notes. The extended 24-hour steep compensates for lower extraction temperature through time. This recipe prioritizes smoothness, low acidity, and sweet chocolate notes—perfect for those who find hot coffee too acidic or bitter. The concentrate format provides flexibility: mix strong or weak according to preference, serve hot or cold, and store for up to 2 weeks refrigerated.

**Recipe Source**: Modern cold brew movement, café culture adaptation for home brewing
**Derived From**: Traditional cold brew techniques, Toddy system methods
**Based On**: Immersion brewing principles and cold extraction science

**Best For**:
- Coffee drinkers seeking low-acid, smooth coffee (acid reflux, sensitive stomachs)
- Hot weather and iced coffee enthusiasts (refreshing, cold, ready to drink)
- Busy lifestyles (batch brew lasts 1-2 weeks refrigerated)
- Anyone who finds hot coffee too bitter or acidic
- Budget-conscious coffee lovers (concentrate stretches beans)
- Beginners to coffee (very forgiving, hard to mess up)
- Versatile base for coffee drinks (lattes, iced drinks, cocktails)

**Not Ideal For**:
- Those seeking bright acidity and complex fruit notes (hot brewing better)
- Light roast showcase (cold brew masks delicate characteristics)
- Immediate gratification (requires 24-hour wait)
- Small quantities (better to batch brew for multiple servings)
- Espresso-like concentration and intensity (different extraction profile)

- **Peru** (Cusco, Cajamarca) - Good for smooth, mild, chocolate
- **Honduras** (Copán, Marcala) - Good for caramel, balanced
- **Ethiopia** (Medium to dark roast only) - Interesting for chocolate-berry fusion

**Preferred Coffee Characteristics**:
- **Body**: Full, heavy body preferred (oils and suspended solids create richness)
- **Sweetness**: Naturally sweet origins (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala)
- **Acidity**: Low to moderate acidity (cold brewing reduces further)
- **Flavor**: Chocolate, caramel, nut, cocoa preferred
- **Processing**: Any method works (natural, washed, honey all good)

**Preferred Processing Methods**:
- **Natural/Dry-Processed**: Excellent - emphasizes sweetness, body, fruit undertones
- **Washed/Wet-Processed**: Very good - clean, balanced, smooth
- **Honey-Processed**: Excellent - sweet, smooth, caramel notes
- **Pulped Natural**: Very good - Brazilian style, chocolate-forward
- **Any Processing**: Cold brew very forgiving across processing methods

**Target Roast Level**:
- **Medium**: Optimal (Full City, balanced, sweet, chocolate)
- **Medium-Dark**: Excellent (Full City+, caramel, chocolate, rich)
- **Dark**: Good (Vienna, bold, low-acid, chocolate-forward)
- **Light**: Not recommended (acidity muted but delicate notes also lost)
- **Light-Medium**: Acceptable but not ideal (better origins for cold brew exist)

**Target Roast Development**:
- Medium to long development time (1.5-3 minutes after first crack)
- Caramelization well-developed (chocolate, caramel, sweetness)
- Body development emphasized
- Moderate to low acidity
- Roast date: 1-60 days off roast (cold brew very forgiving with freshness)

**Roast Profile Characteristics**:
- Medium to dark brown color (Agtron 40-60)
- Some surface oil acceptable (especially dark roasts)
- Chocolate, caramel, nut flavor profile
- Low to moderate acidity
- Full body potential

### Works Exceptionally Well With

**Perfect Matches**:
- Brazilian Santos medium roast - Chocolate, nut, caramel, smooth, low-acid perfection
- Colombian Supremo medium-dark roast - Balanced sweetness, chocolate, caramel
- Guatemalan Antigua medium-dark - Cocoa, chocolate, smooth, rich
- Brazilian natural process - Chocolate-strawberry, sweet, full body
- Sumatra Mandheling - Earthy, full-bodied, herbal, low-acid, unique
- Costa Rican honey process - Caramel, brown sugar, smooth, sweet

**Excellent Matches**:
- Any medium to dark roast with chocolate notes
- House blends designed for everyday drinking
- Single-origin Central/South American medium roasts

**Good Matches**:
- Dark roasts (bold, low-acid, chocolate)
- Espresso blends (medium-dark roasts work well)
- Budget-friendly coffees (cold brew forgiving, maximizes quality)
- Slightly stale coffee (1-3 months off roast) - cold brew rescues aged beans

### Avoid With

**Poor Matches**:
- Light roasts emphasizing delicate fruit/floral notes - cold brew mutes these
- Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (light roast) - wasted on cold brew, use hot brewing
- Kenya AA (light roast) - bright acidity lost, delicate notes masked
- Geisha varieties (light roast) - far too expensive and delicate for cold brew
- Extremely dark/French roast - can be bitter even cold brewed, though acceptable

**Why These Don't Work**:
- Light roasts: Delicate fruit and floral notes don't extract well cold, acidity benefit lost
- Premium delicate origins: Cold brew masks subtle characteristics, economic waste
- Extremely dark roasts: Carbon notes can still appear, though less bitter than hot
- Old, stale coffee: While more forgiving than hot brewing, still noticeable quality decline

### Core Recipe (1:5 Concentrate Method)

**Coffee and Water**:
- **Coffee Dose**: 200g (approximately 1.5 cups whole beans or 2 cups coarse ground)
- **Water Volume**: 1000ml (1 liter or 4 cups)
- **Brewing Ratio**: 1:5 (coffee:water by weight)
- **Output**: Approximately 700-800ml concentrate (after grounds absorb some water)
- **Serving Dilution**: 1:1 (concentrate:water, milk, or ice)
- **Final Servings**: 14-16 servings (8oz each after dilution)

**Grind Settings**:
- **Grind Size**: Coarse (like raw sugar or sea salt crystals)
- **Visual Reference**: Large, chunky particles (not fine powder)
- **Comparison**: Same as French press grind, coarser than pour over
- **Grinder Settings**:
  - Baratza Encore: 28-35
  - Comandante: 30-36 clicks
  - Other grinders: Coarsest or near-coarsest setting
- **Why Coarse**: Prevents over-extraction during 24-hour steep, reduces bitterness and silt

**Water Type**:
- **Temperature**: Cold tap water (15-20°C / 60-70°F) or room temperature (20-24°C / 68-75°F)
- **Quality**: Filtered water preferred (removes chlorine, off-flavors)
- **TDS**: 50-150 ppm (same as hot brewing)
- **Avoid**: Distilled water (under-extracts), heavily mineralized water (can taste chalky)
- **Cold vs Room Temperature**: Both work, room temperature extracts slightly more (still in acceptable range)

**Steep Time**:
- **Standard**: 24 hours (optimal extraction, balanced flavor)
- **Minimum**: 18 hours (acceptable, slightly weaker)
- **Maximum**: 30 hours (acceptable, slightly stronger, risk of over-extraction)
- **Target**: 24 hours for consistency and optimal flavor

**Steep Location**:
- **Refrigerator**: Cold steep (40°F / 4°C) - slower extraction, cleaner flavor
- **Room Temperature**: Faster extraction, more pronounced flavors
- **Recommendation**: Refrigerator for smoothest results and food safety

### Parameter Ranges and Flexibility

**Ratio Adjustments**:
- **1:4** (200g coffee, 800ml water): Stronger concentrate, more intense, dilute 1:1.5 or 1:2
- **1:5** (200g coffee, 1000ml water): Standard, recommended, optimal balance
- **1:6** (200g coffee, 1200ml water): Weaker concentrate, milder, dilute 1:1 or drink straight
- **1:7** (200g coffee, 1400ml water): Very weak, almost ready-to-drink strength (minimal dilution needed)

**Steep Time Variations**:
- **12 hours**: Very weak, underextracted (emergency only)
- **18 hours**: Weak but acceptable (if rushed)
- **24 hours**: Optimal (recommended standard)
- **30 hours**: Strong, fully extracted (acceptable if forgot)
- **36+ hours**: Risk of over-extraction, slightly bitter notes emerging (not recommended)

**Grind Size Adjustments**:
- **Coarser** (French press+): Cleaner cup, less body, need longer steep (28-30 hours)
- **Standard Coarse** (French press): Optimal, balanced (24 hours)
- **Medium-Coarse** (between French press and pour over): More body, risk of over-extraction (20-22 hours)
- **Never Fine**: Will over-extract, create sludge, bitter, undrinkable

**Temperature Variations**:
- **Refrigerator** (40°F): Slowest extraction, cleanest flavor, food-safe (24 hours optimal)
- **Room Temperature** (70°F): Faster extraction, more flavor (20-22 hours sufficient)
- **Cold Water Room Temp Steep**: Balanced approach (24 hours works well)
- **Never Hot**: Defeats purpose of cold brew, creates different flavor profile

### Dilution and Serving Options

**Dilution Ratios** (For 1 part concentrate):
- **1:1** (concentrate:water): Standard strength, balanced (most common)
- **1:0.5** (concentrate:half water): Strong, bold, intense coffee flavor
- **1:1.5** (concentrate:more water): Mild, light, approachable
- **1:2** (concentrate:double water): Very mild, tea-like (for sensitive palates)
- **Undiluted**: Very strong, espresso-like intensity (not recommended for most)

**Serving Methods**:
- **Iced Cold Brew**: Concentrate + ice (ice melts to dilute, standard serving)
- **Cold Brew with Water**: Concentrate + cold water (precise dilution control)
- **Cold Brew with Milk**: Concentrate + milk (latte-style, creamy)

**Step 2: Measure Coffee**
- Place container on scale, tare to zero
- Weigh out 200g whole coffee beans
- OR measure 2 cups coarse ground coffee (if buying pre-ground)
- Fresh beans preferred but not critical (cold brew forgiving)
- Room temperature beans (no need to pre-chill)

**Step 3: Grind Coffee** (If Grinding Fresh)
- Set grinder to coarse setting (French press grind)
- Grind all 200g beans
- Resulting grind should be chunky, like raw sugar crystals
- Dump grounds into cold brew maker or container
- Tap out all grounds from grinder (minimize waste)

**Step 4: Measure Water**
- Measure 1000ml (1 liter) cold or room temperature filtered water
- OR measure 4 cups water (using measuring cup)
- Water should be cool or room temperature (not hot)
- Filtered water preferred (removes chlorine, improves taste)

### Brewing Phase (Active Time: 5 minutes)

**Step 5: Combine Coffee and Water**
- Pour coffee grounds into brewing container
- Add all measured water to coffee grounds
- **Important**: Add water slowly at first to avoid splashing
- Ensure all grounds come in contact with water

**Step 6: Initial Stirring**
- Use long spoon or stirring utensil
- Stir gently but thoroughly (30-60 seconds)
- Goal: Saturate all coffee grounds completely
- Break up any dry clumps floating on surface
- All grounds should be wet and submerged
- **Critical**: Dry grounds won't extract, creating weak spots in brew

**Step 7: Check for Full Saturation**
- Visually inspect surface
- No dry grounds should be floating
- All coffee should be submerged or saturated
- If needed, stir again briefly
- Push down any floating grounds with spoon

**Step 8: Cover Container**
- Cover container with lid or plastic wrap
- If using French press, place plunger on top (don't press yet)
- If using mason jar, screw on lid
- If using open container, cover with plastic wrap (prevents contamination and oxidation)

**Step 9: Note Start Time and Place**
- Note current time (or set 24-hour timer)
- Place container in refrigerator (recommended) or room temperature location
- Refrigerator preferred: cleaner flavor, food-safe, consistent temperature
- Room temperature acceptable: faster extraction, more pronounced flavors
- **Steep Duration**: 24 hours from this moment

### Steeping Phase (Passive Time: 24 hours)

**Step 10: Wait and Ignore** (0-23 Hours)
- Leave container undisturbed for 24 hours
- No stirring needed during steep (though brief stir at 12 hours optional)
- No temperature monitoring needed
- No interventions required
- **Patience**: This is passive brewing, no action needed

**Step 11: Optional Mid-Steep Stir** (12 Hours)
- Optionally stir very gently at 12-hour mark
- Redistributes grounds for even extraction
- Not required but can improve consistency
- Return to refrigerator/location after stirring

### Straining and Finishing (Active Time: 10-15 minutes)

**Step 12: Prepare Straining Setup** (After 24 Hours)
- Place fine mesh strainer over large bowl or pitcher
- Line strainer with cheesecloth, coffee filter, or use as-is
- Prepare storage container for final concentrate
- Have spatula ready for scraping

**Step 13: First Strain (Remove Grounds)**
- If using French press: Slowly press plunger down, pour out liquid
- If using cold brew maker: Open spigot and drain into container
- If using jar/container: Pour through fine mesh strainer
- **Goal**: Remove bulk of coffee grounds
- Don't rush, let gravity drain slowly (5-10 minutes)
- Press gently on grounds to extract remaining liquid (don't force)

**Step 14: Second Strain (Clarify)**
- Strain first-pass concentrate again through coffee filter or very fine strainer
- This removes fine particles and sediment
- Creates clean, clear concentrate
- Slow process (10-15 minutes for complete filtering)
- **Result**: Crystal clear concentrate (or slightly opaque, both acceptable)

**Step 15: Discard Spent Grounds**
- Remove used coffee grounds from filter/container
- Dispose in compost or trash
- Rinse brewing equipment immediately (grounds harder to clean if dried)

**Step 16: Store Concentrate**
- Pour clarified concentrate into airtight storage container
- Label container with date made
- Store in refrigerator immediately
- **Shelf Life**: 1-2 weeks refrigerated (best within 1 week)

### Serving and Consumption

## 🎯 Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Problem: Weak, Watery Cold Brew

**Symptoms**:
- Lacks coffee flavor intensity
- Tastes diluted even before diluting
- Light color (pale brown)
- No body or richness
- Underwhelming taste

**Causes**:
- Coffee-to-water ratio too low (too much water, not enough coffee)
- Grind too coarse (insufficient surface area for extraction)
- Steep time too short (under 18 hours)
- Grounds not fully saturated during brewing
- Old, stale coffee (lost flavor potency)

**Solutions**:
- Increase coffee dose to 200g or reduce water to maintain 1:5 ratio
- Grind slightly finer (still coarse, but smaller particles)
- Steep full 24 hours minimum
- Stir thoroughly at start to saturate all grounds
- Use fresh coffee (under 2 months off roast)
- Dilute less when serving (try 1:0.5 or undiluted if really weak)

### Problem: Bitter, Over-Extracted Cold Brew

**Symptoms**:
- Bitter, unpleasant taste (even cold brewed)
- Harsh, astringent finish

## 📊 Science and Theory of Cold Brew

### Cold Extraction Chemistry

**What Extracts in Cold Brewing**:
- **Acids**: Lower extraction of chlorogenic acids (60-70% less than hot brew)
- **Sugars**: Full extraction of sugars (sweetness preserved)
- **Oils**: Lower extraction of bitter oils and lipids
- **Caffeine**: Full extraction (similar or slightly higher than hot brew per gram)
- **Aromatics**: Different aromatic compound extraction (less volatile aromatics)

**Temperature and Solubility**:
- Cold water extracts fewer compounds overall (lower solubility)
- Time compensates for temperature (24 hours vs 4 minutes hot brewing)
- Different compounds extracted at different rates cold vs hot
- Result: Fundamentally different flavor profile, not just "cold coffee"

**Why Cold Brew Tastes Different**:
- **Low Acidity**: Fewer acidic compounds extracted (smoother, less bright)
- **High Sweetness**: Sugar extraction maintained (perceive sweetness more)
- **Low Bitterness**: Bitter oils under-extracted (smooth, not harsh)
- **Chocolate/Caramel**: These compounds extract well cold (emphasized)
- **Missing Brightness**: Acidic brightness absent (trade-off for smoothness)

**pH Comparison**:
- **Hot Coffee**: pH 4.85-5.10 (moderately acidic)
- **Cold Brew**: pH 5.60-6.20 (significantly less acidic)
- **Impact**: Cold brew easier on stomach, teeth, digestive system

### Extraction Over Time

**Hour-by-Hour Extraction** (Approximate):
- **0-6 hours**: Surface compounds, initial sugars (weak, underdeveloped)
- **6-12 hours**: Deeper extraction, developing flavor (still weak)
- **12-18 hours**: Main extraction phase, flavor building (acceptable strength)
- **18-24 hours**: Full extraction, optimal balance (target window)
- **24-30 hours**: Maximum extraction, slight over-extraction risk (still good)
- **30+ hours**: Over-extraction territory, bitterness can emerge (diminishing returns)

**Why 24 Hours is Optimal**:
- Balanced extraction of desirable compounds
- Avoids over-extraction of bitter compounds
- Consistent results (easy to time)
- Sweet spot between underdevelopment and over-extraction

### Grind Size Impact

**Why Coarse Grind is Essential**:
- **Surface Area**: Coarse grind has less surface area (slower extraction)
- **Time Compensation**: 24 hours compensates for lower surface area
- **Over-Extraction Prevention**: Fine grind would over-extract in 24 hours
- **Filtering**: Coarse grounds easier to filter out (less silt)

**Particle Size and Extraction**:
- Larger particles extract slower (need more time)
- Smaller particles extract faster (would over-extract in 24 hours)
- Coarse grind perfect for 24-hour steep
- Think: More time = coarser grind needed (inverse relationship)

### Caffeine Content

**Caffeine in Cold Brew**:
- **Per Gram Coffee**: Similar extraction to hot brewing (caffeine very soluble)
- **Per Serving**: Often higher due to concentrate dilution habits
- **Concentrate**: Very high caffeine (200-300mg per 8oz undiluted)
- **Diluted 1:1**: Moderate to high (100-150mg per 8oz serving)
- **Comparison**: Similar to hot drip coffee per gram, but servings vary

**Managing Caffeine**:
- Dilute more for lower caffeine (1:1.5 or 1:2)
- Use less concentrate per serving
- Switch to half-caff or decaf beans

### Storage and Shelf Life

**Why Refrigeration Essential**:
- Cold brew concentrate has sugars (bacteria food source)
- Room temperature storage = rapid spoilage (24-48 hours)
- Refrigeration slows bacterial growth (1-2 weeks shelf life)
- Oxidation slower when cold (preserves flavor)

**Freshness Timeline**:
- **Days 1-4**: Peak freshness, optimal flavor
- **Days 5-7**: Excellent, minimal degradation
- **Days 8-10**: Good, slight flavor fade
- **Days 11-14**: Acceptable, noticeable decline
- **Days 15+**: Declining quality, potential spoilage risk
