## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water, cool to 93°C
   - Weigh 22g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium (drip coffee grind)
   - Place filter in Clever Dripper
   - **Rinse filter** with hot water
   - Place Clever on scale (not on mug yet!)
   - **Critical**: Clever seals when placed on mug
   - Discard rinse water
   - Add ground coffee to Clever
   - Tare scale

2. **Add Water - All at Once** (0:00)
   - Start timer
   - Pour all 350g water relatively quickly
   - No need for perfect technique - just saturate all grounds
   - Complete by 0:30
   - This is much easier than V60!

3. **Quick Stir** (0:30)
   - Stir gently 5-10 times
   - Ensure all coffee is saturated
   - Break up any clumps
   - Coffee will float then sink

4. **Place Lid and Steep** (0:30 - 3:00)
   - Place lid on Clever (reduces heat loss)
   - Let steep undisturbed
   - **Steep for 2:30 total** (from start time)
   - Full immersion extraction happening
   - Coffee is sealed in - no dripping

5. **Release** (3:00)
   - At 3:00, place Clever on mug or server
   - This releases valve and drainage begins
   - Watch coffee drain through
   - This is the "magic moment"

6. **Drawdown** (3:00 - 4:00)
   - Coffee drains through filter
   - Should take 1:00-1:30
   - If draining very fast (<0:45) - grind finer next time
   - If very slow (>2:00) - grind coarser next time
   - Remove Clever when dripping stops

7. **Finish** (4:00)
   - Remove Clever
   - Discard filter and grounds
   - Swirl coffee in mug
   - Serve immediately
   - Enjoy consistent, clean coffee

### Technique Notes

**Key Advantage**: Immersion means extraction isn't dependent on perfect pour technique
**Valve System**: Clever seals until placed on cup - prevents premature drainage
**Simplicity**: Much more forgiving than V60 or Chemex
**Consistency**: Very consistent results batch to batch
**Cleanup**: Easy - just remove filter and grounds

**Critical Points**:
- Don't place on mug until ready to drain (valve releases)
- Lid reduces heat loss during steep
- One simple stir is enough
- Drawdown time indicates grind size
- Much more forgiving than pure pour-over

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.30-1.45%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 20-22%
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied with good clarity
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Clean, balanced, full extraction

**Success Criteria**:
- Steep time 2:30-3:00
- Drawdown 1:00-1:30
- Clean cup with some body
- Balanced, well-extracted coffee
- Consistent results

**Signs of Success**:
- Even saturation during pour
- Steady immersion steep
- Smooth, even drawdown
- Clean cup with good body
- Balanced flavor (not sour, not bitter)
- Consistent results every time

**Signs of Failure**:
- Very fast drawdown (<0:45) - grind finer
- Very slow drawdown (>2:00) - grind coarser
- Bitter - steep too long or water too hot
- Sour/weak - steep too short or water too cool
- Inconsistent - check grind consistency

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If drawdown fast → grind finer
- If drawdown slow → grind coarser
- If bitter → shorter steep or lower temp
- If weak → longer steep or hotter water

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Don't place on mug until ready** - valve releases when placed
- Lid is important - reduces heat loss during steep
- Much easier than V60 - no pour technique needed
- Very consistent results - great for dialing in coffees
- Immersion + paper filter = body + clarity
- Perfect for beginners learning specialty coffee
- Great for travel (more durable than glass pour-overs)
- Office-friendly - consistent without technique
- Cleanup is easy - just remove filter

**Common Mistakes**:
- Placing on mug too early - coffee drains during steep
- Not rinsing filter - papery taste
- Grinding same as V60 - should be slightly coarser
- Not using lid - heat loss affects extraction
- Judging by total time instead of steep time - drawdown varies

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: Longer steep, finer grind, or more coffee
- **Too Bitter**: Shorter steep, lower temp, or coarser grind
- **Fast Drawdown**: Grind finer
- **Slow Drawdown**: Grind coarser
- **Inconsistent**: Check grind consistency, ensure full saturation

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Premature Draining**: Don't place on mug until ready
- **Slow Drawdown**: Grind coarser or ensure filter not clogged
- **Bitter**: Reduce steep time or lower temperature
- **Weak**: Increase steep time, use hotter water, or more coffee
- **Papery Taste**: Rinse filter more thoroughly

## 📝 Notes

The Clever Dripper is the "easy button" for specialty coffee. It combines the forgiveness of immersion brewing with the clarity of pour-over filtration. Perfect for consistent results without mastering pour technique.

**Clever Dripper Philosophy**:
Clever was designed in 2009 to solve pour-over's technique requirements. The genius is the valve system - coffee steeps in sealed chamber (forgiving immersion), then drains through paper filter (clean cup). You get AeroPress-like consistency with V60-like clarity.

**Why Clever Is Brilliant**:
1. **Immersion eliminates pour technique** - just add water and wait
2. **Valve system prevents premature drainage** - full control over steep time
3. **Paper filtration creates clean cup** - no sediment
4. **Very consistent results** - less technique dependency
5. **Easy cleanup** - remove filter, done
6. **Affordable** - $20-30 for quality brewer

**Clever vs Other Methods**:
- **vs V60**: Much easier, more forgiving, slightly less potential clarity
- **vs AeroPress**: Similar concept, Clever is simpler (no pressing), V60-style cup
- **vs French Press**: Cleaner cup (paper filter), easier cleanup, more clarity
- **vs Chemex**: Easier technique, similar clarity, better for single servings

**Best Use Cases**:
- Learning specialty coffee (perfect gateway)
- Consistent daily brewing (excellent)
- Office brewing (great - no technique needed)
- Travel (durable, simple)
- Dialing in new coffees (consistent for testing)
- When you want pour-over results without pour-over technique

**Perfect Coffees for Clever**:
- Literally any coffee - Clever is universally excellent
- Great for showcasing complex light roasts
- Excellent for balanced medium roasts
- Very good for dark roasts (forgiving immersion)

**Underrated Method**:
Clever is underrated in specialty coffee. It's dismissed as "beginner" method, but it produces excellent coffee with minimal technique. For most people brewing at home or office, Clever is arguably the best choice - great coffee, consistent results, minimal technique required.

**Competition Use**:
Clever is rarely used in competitions (not flashy enough), but many competition baristas use Clever at home for daily brewing. That tells you something about its practical excellence.

**Size Options**:
- **Medium (300ml)**: Single large cup or 2 small cups - this recipe
- **Large (500ml)**: 2-3 cups
- Choose based on typical serving size

**Economic Reality**:
$25 brewer + $10 filters (100 count) produces coffee equal to $150+ pour-over setups. This is specialty coffee's best value.

**Perfect for**: Anyone who wants excellent, consistent coffee without mastering complex pour technique. Clever is the method I'd recommend to 80% of home brewers.
