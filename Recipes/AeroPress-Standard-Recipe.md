## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps (Standard Position)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water, cool to 92°C
   - Weigh 17g coffee
   - Grind to medium-fine
   - Insert paper filter in cap
   - Rinse filter with hot water
   - Assemble AeroPress on mug/server
   - Add ground coffee to chamber
   - Tare scale

2. **Add Water** (0:00 - 0:10)
   - Start timer
   - Pour all 250g water
   - Pour steadily to saturate all grounds
   - Complete by 0:10
   - Water level will be near top

3. **Stir** (0:10 - 0:15)
   - Stir gently 10 times in circular motion
   - Ensure all coffee is saturated
   - Break up any clumps
   - Complete by 0:15

4. **Insert Plunger** (0:15)
   - Insert plunger ~1cm
   - Creates vacuum seal
   - Prevents drip-through
   - This is critical step

5. **Steep** (0:15 - 1:30)
   - Wait until 1:30
   - Coffee steeps in chamber
   - Minimal drip-through due to vacuum
   - This is where extraction happens

6. **Press** (1:30 - 2:00)
   - At 1:30, begin pressing gently
   - Press steadily and evenly
   - Take ~30 seconds to complete press
   - Stop when you hear hissing
   - Don't press final air through

7. **Finish** (2:00)
   - Remove AeroPress
   - Discard puck (pops out cleanly)
   - Swirl coffee in mug
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Steady pour to saturate all grounds
**Agitation Method**: 10 gentle stirs
**Press Technique**: Steady, even pressure over 30 seconds
**Vacuum Seal**: Critical for preventing drip-through
**Target Puck**: Should be compact and dry

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If press too easy → grind finer
- If press too hard → grind coarser
- If bitter → lower temperature
- If sour → raise temperature

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**Variations**:
- **Inverted Method**: Flip AeroPress upside down (more control, riskier)
- **Diluted Version**: Use 15g coffee, 200g water, dilute with 50g after
- **Concentrated**: Use 20g coffee, 200g water (1:10 ratio)
- **Cold Brew**: Use room temp water, steep 2 minutes, press (!)
- **Prismo Method**: Use Fellow Prismo for espresso-style
- **Metal Filter**: Use metal filter for more oils and body

**When to Use Variations**:
- Inverted: When you want maximum control and steep time
- Diluted: American-style coffee or to stretch good beans
- Concentrated: For milk drinks or personal preference
- Cold brew: Quick cold coffee method
- Prismo: Espresso-style coffee

**Alternative Ratios**:
- 1:13 (concentrated, strong)
- 1:15 (standard, balanced)
- 1:17 (lighter, can dilute after)

**Alternative Temperatures**:

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Vacuum seal is critical** - insert plunger to prevent drip-through
- Rinse filter to remove paper taste
- Press gently and steadily - don't rush
- Stop pressing when you hear hissing
- Grind consistency matters more than exact size
- AeroPress is incredibly forgiving
- Easy cleanup - puck pops out cleanly
- Great for travel, camping, office
- Very consistent results
- Works with any coffee

**Common Mistakes**:
- Not creating vacuum seal - causes drip-through and weak coffee
- Pressing too fast - can cause bitter extraction
- Pressing final air through - adds bitterness
- Grinding too fine - makes pressing difficult
- Not rinsing filter - papery taste
- Using boiling water - over-extracts

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: More coffee, finer grind, or longer steep
- **Too Strong**: Less coffee, coarser grind, or shorter steep
- **Bitter**: Lower temperature, coarser grind, or faster press
- **Sour**: Higher temperature, finer grind, or longer steep
- **Hard to Press**: Grind coarser
- **Press Too Easy**: Grind finer

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Dripping Before Press**: Ensure plunger inserted to create vacuum
- **Filter Bursts**: Don't press too hard, check filter installation
- **Weak Coffee**: More coffee, finer grind, ensure vacuum seal
- **Bitter Coffee**: Lower temperature, press faster
- **Inconsistent**: Focus on consistent grind, water temp, and timing

## 📝 Notes

The AeroPress is one of the most versatile and forgiving brewing methods. This standard recipe works with virtually any coffee and produces consistently good results. It's perfect for beginners while still capable of excellent coffee.

**Why AeroPress Is Special**:
- Incredibly forgiving - hard to make bad coffee
- Very consistent results
- Fast brewing (2 minutes total)
- Easy cleanup
- Portable - great for travel, camping, office
- Versatile - can make everything from filter coffee to espresso-style
- Affordable
- Nearly indestructible

**AeroPress Philosophy**:
The AeroPress excels at "good enough" coffee. It won't make the absolute best cup possible (like competition V60 can), but it consistently makes very good coffee with minimal effort and expertise. For most people, most of the time, that's perfect.

**Best Use Cases**:
- Travel and camping (perfect)
- Office brewing (excellent)
- Weekday mornings (very good)
- Learning coffee brewing (great for beginners)
- Single servings (ideal)
- Inconsistent water temperature (forgiving)

**Compared to Other Methods**:
- **vs V60**: Less complexity, more consistency, slightly less clarity
- **vs French Press**: Cleaner cup, faster, easier cleanup
- **vs Espresso**: Obviously different, but Prismo method gets close
- **vs Pour-over**: More body, less brightness, more forgiving

**World Championships**: The AeroPress World Championship produces wildly different winning recipes every year, proving there's no single "correct" way. This recipe is a reliable standard that works well.
