## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation**
   - Weigh 200g coffee beans
   - Grind to coarse (French press or coarser)
   - Weigh 1000g room temperature water
   - Prepare cold brew maker or large container
   - Optional: use filtered water for best results

2. **Combine** (Day 1, Evening)
   - Add ground coffee to container
   - Add all water
   - Stir gently to ensure all grounds saturated
   - Ensure no dry pockets
   - Cover container
   - Note start time

3. **Steep** (12-24 hours)
   - Let steep at room temperature OR
   - Steep in refrigerator (some prefer this)
   - Do not disturb during steeping
   - **Room temp**: 12-16 hours
   - **Refrigerator**: 18-24 hours (slower extraction)
   - Longer steep = stronger, more bitter
   - Shorter steep = lighter, brighter

4. **Strain** (Day 2, Next Day)
   - Prepare filter system
   - Strain through paper filter, cloth, or nut milk bag
   - This takes time - be patient (15-30 minutes)
   - Don't press grounds (increases bitterness)
   - Let gravity do the work
   - Can double-strain for ultra-clean result

5. **Store**
   - Transfer to clean container
   - Cover and refrigerate
   - Label with date
   - Lasts 1-2 weeks refrigerated
   - Concentrate ready to use

6. **Serve**
   - Dilute concentrate 1:1 with water or milk
   - Pour over ice
   - Add sweetener if desired
   - Enjoy smooth, cold coffee

### Technique Notes

**Water Temp**: Room temp extracts faster, refrigerator slower
**Steep Time**: Longer increases strength and slight bitterness
**Straining**: Don't press - let gravity work
**Dilution**: 1:1 is standard, adjust to taste
**Storage**: Refrigerate concentrate, lasts 1-2 weeks

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target Strength**: Concentrate (dilute before drinking)
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Smooth, sweet, chocolatey, low acidity
- **Characteristics**: No bitterness, no sourness, round and sweet

**Success Criteria**:
- Smooth, concentrated cold brew
- Low acidity, minimal bitterness
- Chocolate, caramel notes
- No off flavors
- Clean strain (minimal sediment)

**Signs of Success**:
- Dark brown concentrate
- Smooth, sweet taste when diluted
- Low acidity
- Chocolate/caramel notes
- Clean (no excessive sediment)
- Pleasant even at high strength

**Signs of Failure**:
- Muddy, excessive sediment - grind too fine
- Sour taste - under-extracted (steep longer)
- Bitter taste - over-extracted (steep less or coarser grind)
- Weak concentrate - not enough coffee or too short steep
- Off flavors - old beans or contaminated equipment

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If too weak → more coffee or longer steep
- If bitter → shorter steep or coarser grind
- If muddy → grind coarser, better filtering
- If sour → steep longer

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**Variations**:
- **Ready-to-Drink**: Use 1:8 ratio (not concentrate)
- **Extra Strong**: Use 1:4 ratio
- **Flavored**: Add vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa nibs during steep
- **Hot Bloom Method**: Bloom coffee with hot water first, then add cold
- **Nitro Cold Brew**: Infuse concentrate with nitrogen

**When to Use Variations**:
- Ready-to-drink: Don't want to dilute later
- Extra strong: For milk-heavy drinks
- Flavored: Add variety
- Hot bloom: Brighter flavors, faster extraction
- Nitro: Creamy texture, special treat

**Alternative Ratios**:
- 1:4 (extra strong concentrate)
- 1:5 (standard concentrate)
- 1:6 (mild concentrate)
- 1:8 (ready-to-drink, not concentrate)

**Alternative Steep Times**:
- 12 hours (minimum, lighter)
- 16 hours (standard)
- 20 hours (stronger)

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Make batches** - cold brew stores 1-2 weeks, make large batches
- Use filtered water for best taste
- Coarse grind is critical - too fine creates muddy brew
- Don't press grounds when straining - increases bitterness
- Room temp steeping is faster than refrigerator
- Label with date - track freshness
- Perfect make-ahead option for busy weeks
- Dilute to taste - some prefer 1:2 ratio
- Excellent base for milk drinks, iced lattes
- Very cost-effective vs buying cold brew

**Common Mistakes**:
- Grinding too fine - creates muddy, bitter brew
- Steeping too long (>24 hours) - excessive bitterness
- Pressing grounds when straining - releases bitterness
- Not saturating all grounds - weak, uneven extraction
- Using light roast coffees - cold brew mutes their best qualities
- Not refrigerating concentrate - spoils quickly

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: More coffee, longer steep time
- **Too Bitter**: Shorter steep, coarser grind, don't press when straining
- **Too Muddy**: Grind coarser, better filtering, don't press
- **Sour/Underextracted**: Steep longer (unlikely with 16+ hours)
- **Too Strong**: Use 1:6 ratio or dilute more when serving

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Muddy/Sediment**: Grind coarser, better filter, don't press
- **Bitter**: Steep less time, coarser grind
- **Weak**: More coffee, longer steep
- **Sour**: Steep significantly longer
- **Off Flavors**: Check bean freshness, clean equipment

## 📝 Notes

Cold brew is the make-ahead champion of coffee brewing. Make a batch on Sunday, enjoy smooth iced coffee all week. The long, cold extraction creates a fundamentally different flavor profile than hot coffee - lower acidity, more sweetness, smooth even at high concentrations.

**Cold Brew Philosophy**:
Cold brew extracts differently than hot brewing. Cold water extracts fewer acids and bitter compounds while extracting sugars and chocolate notes. The result is smooth, sweet, low-acid coffee that's perfect for iced drinks.

**Cold Brew vs Iced Coffee**:
- **Cold Brew**: Brewed cold over 12-24 hours, smooth, low-acid, concentrated
- **Iced Coffee** (Flash Brew): Hot coffee over ice, bright, acidic, aromatic
- **When to Use Cold Brew**: Make-ahead, milk drinks, prefer smooth/low-acid
- **When to Use Flash Brew**: Want bright acidity, aromatic, single servings

**Best Use Cases**:
- Make-ahead for busy weeks (perfect)
- Summer iced coffee (excellent)
- Milk-based iced drinks (excellent - concentrate mixes well)
- Low-acid coffee needs (very good)
- Batch brewing for multiple days (ideal)
- Office/work - bring concentrate, dilute daily (great)

**Perfect Coffees for Cold Brew**:
- Brazilian natural/pulped natural (chocolate, caramel, nuts)
- Colombian medium roast (balanced, sweet)
- Indonesian (earthy, full-bodied)
- Medium to medium-dark roasts (sweet, smooth)

**Cost Analysis**:
Making cold brew at home costs ~$1.50-2.00 per serving vs $4-6 at cafés. At 2 servings/day, saves $700-1000+ per year.

**Commercial Cold Brew**:
Most commercial cold brew is made using this method at scale. Some use Toddy systems, others use large-batch immersion vessels. The principle is identical - coarse grind, cold water, long steeping, no pressure.

**Concentrate Benefits**:
Making concentrate (vs ready-to-drink) offers flexibility:
- Dilute to desired strength
- Use for milk drinks at full strength
- Takes less storage space
- Lasts longer (higher concentration more stable)
