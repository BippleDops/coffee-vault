## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Quick Steps (3-Minute Method)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water (let cool 30 sec if no temp control)
   - Weigh 30g coffee OR 4 tablespoons
   - Grind to coarse
   - Optional: Preheat press quickly with hot water
   - Add ground coffee to press
   - Start timer (or note time)

2. **Add Water** (0:00)
   - Add all water at once
   - Pour gently but don't overthink it
   - Fill to top of French Press
   - Don't stir yet

3. **Steep** (0:00 - 3:00)
   - Place lid on press (plunger up)
   - Set timer for 3 minutes
   - Walk away - do other morning tasks
   - Crust forms on top (normal)

4. **Stir and Press** (3:00)
   - At 3:00, remove lid
   - Stir gently 5-10 times
   - Crust breaks and sinks
   - Replace lid immediately

5. **Press Gently** (3:00)
   - Press plunger gently to below surface
   - Don't press all the way down
   - Takes 10 seconds
   - Some grounds will remain suspended (okay)

6. **Pour and Serve** (3:00)
   - Pour immediately into mug
   - Don't let sit on grounds (continues extracting)
   - Some sediment is normal
   - Enjoy your quick, full-bodied coffee

### Technique Notes

**Speed vs Quality**: This method sacrifices ~10-15% quality for 50%+ time savings
**Key Simplifications**: No foam removal, shorter steep, quick press
**Still Good**: Produces rich, full-bodied coffee suitable for daily drinking
**Sediment**: Expect more sediment than Hoffmann method (acceptable tradeoff)

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.30-1.45%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 19-21%
- **Target Strength**: Full-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Rich, full body, minimal bitterness

**Success Criteria**:

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Speed is the point** - don't overthink technique
- Coarse grind is critical - prevents sediment
- Can skip preheat if rushed (minor quality loss)
- "Just off boil" water works fine if no thermometer
- Pour immediately - don't let sit on grounds
- Some sediment is normal and acceptable
- Perfect for weekday mornings
- Consistent measurements = consistent results
- Make it part of your routine (shower while steeping)
- 85-90% as good as 8-minute method in 1/3 the time

**Common Mistakes**:
- Grinding too fine - creates muddy, bitter coffee
- Letting sit on grounds - continues extracting, gets bitter
- Pressing hard to bottom - increases sediment
- Overthinking it - this is meant to be simple

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Bitter**: Reduce steep to 2:30, lower temp, or coarser grind
- **Too Weak**: Increase dose to 35g or steep to 3:30
- **Too Much Sediment**: Grind coarser, don't press to bottom
- **Inconsistent**: Measure coffee more carefully

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Bitter Every Time**: Water too hot or steep too long - reduce both
- **Weak Every Time**: Not enough coffee - increase to 35g
- **Gritty/Muddy**: Grind too fine - use coarser setting
- **Can't Repeat Results**: Measure coffee by weight, not volume

## 📝 Notes

This Quick French Press method is designed for real-world weekday mornings when you want good coffee but don't have time for 8-minute Hoffmann method or complex pour-overs. It's honest about the tradeoff: ~10-15% quality reduction for 50%+ time savings.

**The Pragmatic Approach**:
Specialty coffee can be precious about technique. This recipe isn't. It acknowledges that most people brewing at home on weekday mornings want:
1. Good (not perfect) coffee
2. In minimal time
3. With consistent results
4. Without complex technique

This method delivers all four.

**What You're Giving Up**:
Compared to 8-minute Hoffmann method:
- Slightly more bitterness (but still good)
- More sediment in cup (but not gritty)
- Slightly less clarity
- Potentially some over-extraction

**What You're Gaining**:
- 5 minutes of your morning back
- Simpler process (fewer steps)
- Still full-bodied, rich coffee
- Sustainable daily routine

**The Reality Check**:
Perfect coffee technique matters most for:
- Weekend ritual brewing
- Exceptional/expensive beans
- Coffee enthusiast gatherings
- Learning and skill development

Daily weekday morning brewing can be "good enough" without being perfect.

**Comparison to Other Quick Methods**:
- **vs AeroPress**: Similar time, French Press has more body
- **vs Pour-over**: Much faster, less technique required
- **vs Instant**: Incomparably better quality
- **vs Drive-through**: Better, cheaper, faster (after initial setup)

**Economic Reality**:
- Weekday morning café coffee: $4-6 × 5 days = $20-30/week
- This method: <$2/day ($10/week)
- Savings: $520-1,040/year
- Time: 3 minutes at home vs 10-20 minutes drive-through

**Best Use Cases**:
- Weekday morning rush (perfect)
- Office quick brewing (great)
- When you need coffee NOW
- Daily sustainable routine
- When technique doesn't matter, just caffeine

**Not Ideal For**:
- Weekend ritual brewing (use Hoffmann method)
- Expensive/exceptional beans (deserve better technique)
- Impressing guests (use showcase methods)
- Learning coffee technique (use precise methods)

**The Honest Truth**:
This is the method most home brewers should use most mornings. Save the 8-minute Hoffmann method and complex pour-overs for weekends and special beans. Make great coffee sustainable by making it practical.

**Integration Strategy**:
- **Weekdays**: This quick method (3 minutes, good coffee, sustainable)
- **Weekends**: Hoffmann method (8 minutes, excellent coffee, enjoyable ritual)
- **Special beans**: V60 or Chemex (showcase quality)

This creates sustainable coffee routine that doesn't burn you out on complexity.
