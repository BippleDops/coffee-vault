## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps (Hoffmann Method)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water, cool to 93°C
   - Weigh 30g coffee beans
   - Grind to coarse (like breadcrumbs)
   - Preheat French Press with hot water
   - Discard preheat water
   - Add ground coffee to press
   - Start timer

2. **Add Water** (0:00 - 0:10)
   - Add all 500g water
   - Pour gently to saturate all grounds
   - Don't stir yet
   - Complete by 0:10

3. **Steep - Phase 1** (0:10 - 4:00)
   - Place lid on press (plunger up, don't press yet)
   - Steep for 4 minutes
   - Crust will form on top (this is normal and good)
   - Wait full 4 minutes

4. **Break Crust** (4:00)
   - At 4:00, remove lid
   - Stir gently to break crust
   - Crust will sink
   - Foam and floaters remain on surface
   - This releases amazing aroma

5. **Remove Foam** (4:00 - 4:30)
   - Use spoon to scoop off foam and floaters
   - Remove as much surface debris as possible
   - This significantly reduces sediment and bitterness
   - Take your time - this step matters

6. **Steep - Phase 2** (4:30 - 8:00)
   - Replace lid (plunger still up)
   - Steep additional 3-4 minutes
   - Grounds settle to bottom
   - Coffee becomes clearer
   - Wait until 8:00 total

7. **Gentle Press** (8:00)
   - Press plunger very gently
   - Press just to below surface of liquid
   - Don't press grounds at bottom
   - This keeps sediment trapped below

8. **Decant or Serve** (8:00)
   - Pour immediately into cups
   - Or decant into serving vessel
   - Don't let coffee sit on grounds (continues extracting)
   - Expect some sediment (it's part of French Press)

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Gentle pour to avoid agitation
**Crust Breaking**: Gentle stir to break crust at 4:00
**Foam Removal**: Critical step for clarity and reduced bitterness
**Plunge Technique**: Very gentle, just to surface
**Decanting**: Recommended to prevent over-extraction

**Key Differences from Old Method**:
- Stir/break crust at 4:00 (not beginning)
- Remove foam (major improvement)
- Gentle press to surface only (not to bottom)
- Longer steeping (8 minutes total vs 4)

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.35-1.50%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 20-22%
- **Target Strength**: Full-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Rich, full body, chocolatey, oils intact

**Success Criteria**:
- Steep time 8 minutes total
- Foam removed successfully
- Gentle press
- Full-bodied cup with minimal bitterness
- Some sediment acceptable (it's French Press character)

**Signs of Success**:
- Beautiful crust forms at 4:00
- Amazing aroma when breaking crust
- Foam removes cleanly
- Grounds settle well during final steep
- Rich, full-bodied cup
- Minimal bitterness despite body

**Signs of Failure**:
- Excessive bitterness - steep too long or water too hot
- Muddy/gritty - ground too fine or pressed too hard
- Weak body - not enough coffee or grind too coarse
- Thin cup - defeated the purpose of French Press

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If bitter → reduce steep time to 6 minutes total
- If weak → increase dose or grind slightly finer
- If too muddy → grind coarser, press more gently
- If lacks body → this shouldn't happen with French Press

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Coarse grind is critical** - too fine creates muddy cup
- Hoffmann method (foam removal, gentle press) is game-changer
- Decant immediately to prevent over-extraction
- Preheat press for temperature stability
- Use quality burr grinder to minimize fines
- Breaking crust at 4:00 releases amazing aroma - enjoy it
- Some sediment is normal and adds to body
- Don't press hard - gentle press to surface only
- Perfect for batch brewing and lazy mornings

**Common Mistakes**:
- Grinding too fine - creates muddy, bitter, gritty cup
- Pressing hard to bottom - agitates grounds, increases sediment
- Not removing foam - increases bitterness significantly
- Letting coffee sit on grounds - continues extraction, gets bitter
- Skipping preheat - temperature drop during brewing
- Using blade grinder - creates too many fines

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Bitter**: Reduce steep time, lower temperature, or coarser grind
- **Too Weak**: More coffee, slightly finer grind, or hotter water
- **Too Muddy/Gritty**: Grind coarser, don't press hard, better grinder
- **Lacks Body**: Use more coffee, slightly finer grind
- **Sediment Bothers You**: Decant through fine mesh, or use different method

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Excessive Sediment**: Grind coarser, press more gently, better grinder
- **Bitter**: Reduce steep time to 6 minutes, lower temperature
- **Weak**: Increase dose, grind slightly finer
- **Gritty Mouthfeel**: Grind coarser, improve grinder quality

## 📝 Notes

The French Press is the people's brewing method - simple, forgiving, and produces full-bodied coffee with character. Unlike pour-over methods that filter out oils, French Press keeps everything in, creating maximum body and mouthfeel.

**French Press Philosophy**:
French Press represents full immersion brewing at its simplest. No paper filters, no complex pour technique, no precision timing. Just coffee, water, and time. The result is rustic, full-bodied coffee with oils and character intact.

**The Hoffmann Revolution**:
James Hoffmann's French Press method (breaking crust, removing foam, gentle press) transformed French Press from "bitter, muddy" to "clean, full-bodied." This recipe uses his method because it's simply better.

**French Press vs Other Methods**:
- **vs V60**: Opposite profiles - FP is full-bodied, V60 is clean
- **vs Chemex**: Maximum body vs maximum clarity
- **vs AeroPress**: Similar immersion but FP has more body and oils
- **vs Espresso**: Obviously different but FP can be rich and strong

**Best Use Cases**:
- Lazy weekend mornings (set and forget)
- Batch brewing for groups
- Camping (nearly indestructible)
- Office brewing (simple, reliable)
- When you want full-bodied coffee
- Rich, chocolatey coffees

**Perfect Coffees for French Press**:
- Brazilian natural/pulped natural (chocolate, nuts, caramel)
- Indonesian (earthy, full-bodied)
- Colombian medium roast (balanced, sweet)
- Any coffee where you want maximum body

**The Sediment Question**:
Some sediment is normal and part of French Press character. If sediment bothers you, you can:
1. Grind coarser
2. Press more gently
3. Decant through fine mesh
4. Or... use a pour-over method instead

**Historical Note**: French Press was actually patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929, not French. But "Italian Press" doesn't have the same ring to it.
