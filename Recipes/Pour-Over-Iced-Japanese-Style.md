# 📖 Recipe: Pour Over Iced Japanese Style

**Brew Method**: Pour Over (Flash Chilled with Ice)
**Author**: Coffee Vault  
**Created**: 2025-11-02
**Version**: 1.0
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Total Time**: 3-4 minutes

## 📋 Recipe Overview

**Description**: The Japanese iced coffee method—brewing hot coffee directly over ice for immediate chilling, preserving volatile aromatics and creating bright, clean, complex iced coffee impossible with cold brew. This flash-chilling technique extracts coffee's full flavor spectrum with hot water while instantly locking in aromatics through rapid cooling. Unlike cold brew's smooth, mellow profile, Japanese method produces vibrant, fruit-forward, tea-like iced coffee showcasing light roast complexity.

**Recipe Philosophy**: Hot water extracts coffee compounds efficiently, including delicate volatile aromatics lost in cold brewing. Immediate chilling over ice preserves these aromatics while preventing oxidation and bitterness development. The method uses concentrated brewing parameters (more coffee, less water) accounting for ice dilution, resulting in perfectly balanced iced coffee at proper strength. This represents specialty coffee's approach to iced coffee—maximizing flavor, clarity, and complexity rather than smoothness alone.

**Recipe Source**: Japanese specialty coffee culture, modern third-wave adoption
**Derived From**: Traditional Japanese kissaten (coffee house) techniques
**Based On**: Hot extraction with immediate chilling, flash-brew principles

**Best For**:
- Hot weather and summer refreshment (cold, crisp, invigorating)
- Light roast fruit-forward coffees (preserves delicate characteristics)
- Bright, complex iced coffee preference (vs smooth cold brew)
- Quick iced coffee (ready in 4 minutes vs 24 hours cold brew)
- Showcasing Ethiopian, Kenyan, fruit-forward origins cold
- Specialty coffee enthusiasts seeking maximum flavor in iced format
- Those finding cold brew too mellow or one-dimensional

**Not Ideal For**:
- Smooth, low-acid iced coffee preference (cold brew better)
- Making large batches for week (cold brew more practical)
- Dark roast coffee (method designed for light roasts)
- Budget coffee (method showcases quality, exposes flaws)
- Winter drinking (method specifically for cold coffee)

## ⚙️ Recipe Parameters

### Core Recipe (Single Serving, V60 Method)

**Ice and Water Distribution**:
- **Total Liquid**: 250g (hot water + ice, final output)
- **Ice**: 100g (pre-weighed in server before brewing)
- **Hot Water**: 150g (brewed hot, melts ice to reach 250g total)
- **Coffee**: 15-17g
- **Final Ratio**: 1:15-17 (coffee to total liquid after ice melts)
- **Concentrated Ratio During Brewing**: 1:9-10 (coffee to hot water only)

**Why This Works**:
- Hot water extracts efficiently (150g at 94°C)
- Ice immediately chills and dilutes (100g ice melts to ~100g liquid)
- Final liquid (150g brewed + 100g melted ice = 250g total)
- Result: Properly concentrated iced coffee at drinking strength

**Grind Settings**:
- **Grind Size**: Medium-fine (slightly finer than standard V60)
- **Reason**: Concentrated brewing (less water, need more extraction)
- **Comparison**: Between standard pour over and espresso
- **Reference Points**:
  - Baratza Encore: 12-14 (finer than usual pour over)
  - Comandante: 18-22 clicks
  - Fellow Ode: 3-3.5 setting

**Water Temperature**:
- **Light Roasts**: 94-96°C (need high temp for extraction in less water)
- **Light-Medium Roasts**: 92-94°C
- **Why Hotter**: Concentrated brewing needs efficient extraction

**Timing**:
- **Bloom**: 0:00-0:30 (30 second bloom)
- **Main Pours**: 0:30-1:45 (pours over 75 seconds)
- **Drawdown**: 1:45-2:45 (60 second drawdown)
- **Total Time**: 2:30-3:00 (similar to hot brewing)

**Pour Schedule** (For 15g coffee, 150g total water):
- **Bloom**: 30g water (0:00-0:30)
- **First Pour**: 30g → 80g (0:30-0:50)
- **Second Pour**: 80g → 120g (0:50-1:10)
- **Third Pour**: 120g → 150g (1:10-1:30)
- **Drawdown**: Complete by 2:30-3:00

### Parameter Flexibility

**Scaling** (Adjusting Serving Size):
- **Single Serving** (15g coffee):
  - Coffee: 15g
  - Ice: 100g
  - Water: 150g
  - Total: 250ml iced coffee
  
- **Double Serving** (30g coffee):
  - Coffee: 30g
  - Ice: 200g
  - Water: 300g
  - Total: 500ml iced coffee

**Ice-to-Water Ratio Adjustments**:
- **Standard**: 40% ice, 60% hot water (100g ice, 150g water for 250g total)
- **More Ice**: 50% ice, 50% hot water (125g ice, 125g water) - more dilute
- **Less Ice**: 30% ice, 70% hot water (75g ice, 175g water) - stronger
- **Rule**: Ice + Water = Desired Final Volume

**Grind Adjustments**:
- **Finer**: If brew tastes weak, under-extracted (finish time under 2:15)
- **Coarser**: If brew tastes bitter, over-extracted (finish time over 3:15)
- **Target**: 2:30-3:00 total time, balanced taste

**Step 2: Setup Pour Over**
- Place V60 (or dripper) on server with ice
- Insert paper filter
- Rinse filter with hot water (wets filter, preheats dripper)
- **Critical**: Discard rinse water (don't leave in server with ice)
- Re-add ice if any melted during rinsing
- Reset scale to zero (ice weight baseline)

**Step 3: Measure and Grind Coffee**
- Weigh 15g coffee beans
- Grind to medium-fine (finer than standard pour over)
- Add grounds to rinsed filter
- Gently shake V60 to level coffee bed
- Don't tap too hard (want level, not compacted)

**Step 4: Prepare Kettle**
- Heat water to 94-96°C (light roasts)
- Keep kettle at temperature
- Prepare to start timer when first water hits grounds

### Brewing Phase (2:30-3:00 total)

**Step 5: Bloom (0:00-0:30)**
- Start timer and pour simultaneously
- Pour 30g water (2x coffee dose) in slow spiral
- Saturate all grounds evenly
- Center→outward spiral pattern
- **Watch**: Coffee will bloom (release CO2, bubbling)
- Let bloom rest 30 seconds (no additional water)
- Optional: Gentle swirl at 0:15 (ensures saturation)

**Step 6: First Main Pour (0:30-0:50)**
- At 0:30, begin first pour
- Pour steadily to 80g total (adding 50g water)
- Slow, controlled spiral (center→edge→center)
- Maintain steady pour rate (avoid spurts)
- Water level rises in V60
- Coffee begins dripping onto ice (immediate chilling begins)

**Step 7: Second Pour (0:50-1:10)**
- At 0:50 (or when water level dropped slightly), begin second pour
- Pour to 120g total (adding 40g water)
- Same slow spiral technique
- Maintain coffee bed level (even extraction)
- **Listen**: Sound of coffee hitting ice in server

**Step 8: Third Pour (1:10-1:30)**
- At 1:10, begin final pour
- Pour to 150g total (adding final 30g water)
- Gentle, controlled pour
- Center focus, spiraling to maintain flat bed
- Complete pour by 1:30

**Step 9: Drawdown (1:30-2:45)**
- No more water added
- Coffee drains through bed into iced server
- **Watch**: Ice melting, server filling with chilled coffee
- Drawdown should complete 2:30-3:00 total time
- **Visual**: Ice cubes shrinking/melting, liquid increasing

**Step 10: Final Drip**
- When dripping stops or slows to individual drops, remove V60
- Check final weight: Should be ~250g (150g brewed + ~100g melted ice)
- Some ice may remain (acceptable, will continue melting)
- **Perfect**: Mostly melted ice, cold coffee at proper strength

### Serving Phase (Immediate)

**Step 11: Stir and Serve**
- Swirl server gently (integrates any remaining ice melt)
- If ice remains, can leave to continue melting or remove
- Pour into glass over fresh ice (optional, adds dilution)
- OR serve straight from server (already cold and properly diluted)

**Step 12: Garnish** (Optional)
- Citrus wheel (orange, lemon) complements bright iced coffee
- Mint sprig (aromatic, refreshing)
- Nothing (purist approach, let coffee shine)

**Step 13: Drinking**
- **Immediate**: Drink immediately (best fresh)
- **Temperature**: Should be cold, refreshing (40-50°F)
- **Flavor**: Bright, fruit-forward, complex
- **Clarity**: Clean, clear (no cloudiness)
- **Body**: Light, tea-like, crisp

**Step 14: Storage** (If Not Consuming Immediately)
- Can refrigerate 2-4 hours (flavor degrades over time)
- Best consumed fresh (within 30 minutes ideal)
- Aromatics fade with time (unlike cold brew which stable)

- Hot water (94°C) efficiently extracts coffee compounds (higher solubility)
- Volatile aromatics extracted that cold brew misses (esters, aldehydes)
- Full flavor spectrum accessed (acids, sugars, aromatics)
- Bright acidity preserved (citrus, berry, fruit acids)

**Immediate Chilling Benefits**:
- Flash chilling locks in volatile aromatics (prevents escape/degradation)
- Stops extraction immediately (prevents over-extraction, bitterness)
- Preserves brightness (oxidation minimized)
- Clean, clear flavor (no time for degradation)

**Vs Cold Brew**:
- **Cold Brew**: 60-70% less acidity, smooth, mellow, chocolate-forward
- **Japanese Iced**: Full acidity, bright, complex, fruit-forward
- **Cold Brew**: 24-hour slow extraction, different compound profile
- **Japanese Iced**: 3-minute hot extraction + immediate chill, full spectrum
- **Different Tools**: Both excellent, different purposes

**Why Light Roasts Excel**:
- Light roasts preserve delicate fruit/floral compounds
- High acidity refreshing when iced (cold temperature emphasizes acids)
- Complexity showcased (method preserves nuance)
- Brightness and fruit notes star qualities cold
