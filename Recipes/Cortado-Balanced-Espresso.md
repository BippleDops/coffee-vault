## 📋 Recipe Overview

**Description**: The cortado—a perfectly balanced 1:1 ratio of espresso to steamed milk, creating harmony where neither component overwhelms the other. This Spanish café staple (cortado means "cut" in Spanish) showcases espresso's character while milk's warmth and slight sweetness "cut" the intensity. Traditionally served in a Gibraltar glass (4-5oz), the cortado represents the sweet spot between straight espresso and milk-heavy lattes: strong enough to taste the coffee, gentle enough for everyday drinking.

**Recipe Philosophy**: The cortado's beauty lies in perfect balance—equal parts espresso and milk (1:1 ratio) create symbiosis where both shine. Unlike cappuccino's foam emphasis or latte's milk dominance, the cortado uses minimal microfoam and equal proportions. This showcases espresso quality while milk moderates intensity, making it approachable for all-day drinking. The small 4-5oz size concentrates flavor without overwhelming volume.

**Recipe Source**: Spanish café culture, modern specialty coffee adoption
**Derived From**: Traditional Spanish cortado, Gibraltar (San Francisco specialty coffee scene)
**Based On**: Balanced espresso-milk ratios and minimal foam technique

**Best For**:
- Espresso lovers seeking milk's textural enhancement without dilution
- Midday coffee (strong enough for morning, gentle enough for afternoon)
- Appreciating espresso quality through milk (highlights coffee character)
- Small, concentrated milk drinks (between macchiato and cappuccino)
- Those finding cappuccinos too milky, macchiatos too intense
- Specialty light roast espresso base (milk balances brightness)
- All-day drinking (breakfast through afternoon acceptable)

**Not Ideal For**:
- Large beverage preference (cortado traditionally 4-5oz only)
- Heavy milk drink lovers (cortado minimal milk, latte better)
- Those avoiding dairy (oat milk works but less traditional)
- Decaf base (cortado relies on espresso's flavor intensity)

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation Phase

**Step 1: Preheat Glass and Equipment**
- Preheat Gibraltar glass or cortado cup (hot water or machine cup warmer)
- Warm espresso machine and group head (20-30 minutes)
- Prepare clean milk pitcher
- Ensure steam wand ready (adequate pressure)

**Step 2: Measure Milk**
- Measure 100ml (approximately 4oz) cold whole milk
- Pour into 12oz milk pitcher (fills about 1/3 of pitcher)
- Milk should be cold from refrigerator (4-7°C / 40-45°F)

### Espresso Extraction

**Step 3: Grind and Prepare Puck**
- Grind 18-20g coffee (espresso grind)
- Distribute with WDT tool (break all clumps)
- Tamp firmly and level
- Clean portafilter rim
- **(See Espresso recipe for detailed puck preparation)**

**Step 4: Decide Workflow**
- **Option A**: Steam milk first, then pull espresso (milk holds 60-90 seconds)
- **Option B**: Pull espresso first, then steam milk (espresso waits better than milk)
- **Recommended for Cortado**: Steam milk first (easier timing for small milk volume)

### Milk Steaming (Minimal Foam Technique)

**Step 5: Positioning and Aeration** (Minimal for Cortado)
- Purge steam wand (1-2 second burst)
- Position steam wand tip just below milk surface, off-center
- Turn steam to full power
- **Aeration Phase**: Only 1-2 seconds (much shorter than cappuccino)
- **Goal**: Minimal air incorporation (cortado not foam-focused)
- **Sound**: Very brief chirping (1-2 seconds only)

**Step 6: Texturing Phase** (Majority of Time)
- Immediately after brief aeration, submerge tip deeper (0.5-1cm below surface)
- Create rolling whirlpool motion in milk
- **Duration**: 20-30 seconds total steaming time
- **Texture**: Integrating minimal air into liquid milk (wet microfoam)
- **Temperature**: Monitor pitcher warmth with free hand

**Step 7: Finishing Milk**
- Stop steam when temperature reaches 140-150°F (pitcher uncomfortable to hold 2-3 seconds)
- Remove pitcher from steam wand
- Purge steam wand, wipe clean, purge again
- **Critical**: Cortado needs wet microfoam, NOT thick foam

**Step 8: Polish Microfoam**
- Tap pitcher on counter (2-3 taps, breaks any large bubbles)
- Swirl milk in pitcher (5-10 seconds, integrates texture)
- **Result**: Wet paint consistency, glossy, very thin foam layer
- **Check**: Should pour like liquid, not thick foam

### Espresso Extraction (If Not Already Pulled)

**Step 9: Extract Espresso**
- Lock portafilter into group head
- Place preheated glass under spout
- Start extraction and timer
- **Target**: 36-40g liquid espresso in 25-30 seconds
- **Crema**: Should have nice crema layer (indicates fresh coffee, proper extraction)
- **(See Espresso recipe for detailed extraction troubleshooting)**

### Assembly and Serving

**Step 10: Immediate Pour**
- Espresso fresh in preheated glass (crema intact)
- Milk freshly steamed and swirled (wet microfoam ready)
- **Timing**: Pour milk within 30 seconds of steaming (texture degrades quickly)

**Step 11: Pouring Technique**
- Hold glass with one hand
- Hold pitcher with pouring hand
- **Height**: Start pour from 3-4 inches above espresso surface
- **Pour**: Steady, controlled stream into center of espresso
- **Integration**: Milk and espresso integrate (milk doesn't just float on top)
- **Filling**: Continue pouring until glass 3/4 to 4/5 full (4-5oz total)

**Step 12: Optional Latte Art**
- **Simple Heart**: Lower pitcher close to surface near end, create white circle, pull through
- **Traditional**: Many cortados have no art (simple integration acceptable)
- **Minimalist**: Thin white dot or line on surface (subtle)
- **Note**: Cortado's small size makes latte art harder than cappuccino/latte

**Step 13: Serve Immediately**
- Serve on saucer (optional small spoon, though cortado doesn't need stirring)
- **Presentation**: Clean glass exterior, beautiful espresso-milk integration
- **Accompaniment**: Sometimes served with small glass of water (optional)

**Step 14: Drinking**
- **Immediate Drinking**: Cortado best consumed fresh and warm (within 5 minutes)
- **Flavor**: Strong espresso flavor balanced by milk warmth and sweetness
- **Texture**: Velvety, liquid mouthfeel (not thick foam texture)
- **Character**: Both coffee and milk identifiable (neither dominates)
- **Finish**: Clean coffee finish with lingering milk sweetness

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Too Much Foam (Like Cappuccino)

**Symptoms**:
- Thick foam cap on cortado (wrong texture)
- Looks like tiny cappuccino
- Dry, airy foam instead of liquid milk
- Espresso getting lost under foam

**Causes**:
- Over-aeration (steam wand at surface too long)
- Using cappuccino steaming technique (wrong for cortado)
- Not integrating foam properly with swirling

**Solutions**:
- Aerate only 1-2 seconds (much shorter than cappuccino's 3-5 seconds)
- Spend most of time texturing (not aerating)
- Create wet microfoam (liquid-like, not foamy)
- Swirl thoroughly after steaming (integrates any foam)

### Problem: Milk Too Thin/Watery (No Texture)

**Symptoms**:
- Milk lacks body and velvety texture
- Separates from espresso quickly
- Just hot milk, no microfoam
- Thin, watery mouthfeel

**Causes**:
- No aeration phase (tip too deep from start)
- Insufficient texturing time
- Temperature too low (under-heated milk)

**Solutions**:
- Aerate briefly (1-2 seconds at surface)
- Ensure whirlpool motion during texturing (integrates texture)
- Steam to proper temperature (140-150°F)
- Use whole milk (3.25% fat) - skim milk won't work well

### Problem: Ratio Off (Too Much or Too Little Milk)

**Symptoms**:
- Tastes like latte (too much milk, coffee lost)
- OR tastes like macchiato (too little milk, too strong)
- Lost balance (hallmark of cortado)

**Causes**:
- Incorrect milk volume (not measuring)
- Espresso output incorrect (not weighing)
- Using cappuccino cup (too large, pour too much milk)

**Solutions**:
- Weigh espresso output (36-40g target)
- Measure milk before steaming (100ml/4oz)
- Use proper cortado glass/Gibraltar (4-5oz capacity)
- Pour equal amounts (1:1 ratio, if 40g espresso → 40g milk weight approximately)

### Problem: Cortado Too Cold

**Symptoms**:
- Lukewarm, not pleasantly warm
- Lost satisfaction from warmth
- Milk temperature too low

**Causes**:
- Milk under-steamed (under 130°F)
- Glass not preheated (cold glass rapidly cools drink)
- Too much delay between steaming and pouring

**Solutions**:
- Steam milk to 140-150°F (pitcher uncomfortable to hold)
- Always preheat glass/cup thoroughly
- Pour immediately after steaming (within 30 seconds)
