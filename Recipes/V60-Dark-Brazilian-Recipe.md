## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water then cool to 88°C (critical - avoid high temps)
   - Weigh 18g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium-coarse (28 clicks Comandante)
   - Rinse V60 filter with hot water
   - Preheat V60 and server (but not too hot)
   - Tare scale with V60 and coffee

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:40)
   - Start timer
   - Add 50g water (2.8x dose) in circular motion
   - Ensure all grounds saturated (darker roasts bloom less)
   - Gentle swirl to ensure even saturation
   - Wait until 0:40 (shorter bloom for dark roasts)

3. **First Pour** (0:40 - 1:10)
   - Pour to 150g total (100g water added)
   - Slow, controlled spiral from center outward
   - Maintain steady pour height (5-10cm)
   - Complete pour by 1:10

4. **Second Pour** (1:10 - 1:40)
   - Pour to 250g total (100g water added)
   - Same spiral technique
   - Complete pour by 1:40

5. **Final Pour** (1:40 - 2:10)
   - Pour to 288g total (38g water added)
   - Center pour to maintain flat bed
   - Complete pour by 2:10

6. **Drawdown** (2:10 - 2:30)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 2:30
   - Bed should be flat
   - Dark roasts drain faster due to lower density

7. **Finish** (2:30)
   - Remove V60
   - Gentle swirl of brewed coffee
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Gentle, controlled spiral maintaining even flow
**Agitation Method**: Minimal swirl after bloom, very gentle during pours
**Pour Velocity**: Moderate and steady (aim for ~8-10g/second)
**Target Bed Appearance**: Flat, even bed at finish

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.25-1.35%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 19-21%
- **Target Strength**: Full-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Rich chocolate, nutty, smooth, minimal bitterness

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 2:15-2:45
- Flat, even coffee bed at finish
- No channeling
- Rich chocolate aroma
- Smooth, not bitter cup

**Signs of Success**:
- Even bloom despite dark roast
- Steady drawdown without fast channels
- Flat bed at completion
- Rich chocolate, nutty aroma
- Smooth, full-bodied cup without bitterness

**Signs of Failure**:
- Fast drawdown (<2:15) - grind slightly finer or increase dose
- Bitter taste - lower temperature further or coarser grind
- Thin/weak - grind finer or increase dose
- Astringent - definitely lower temperature

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If finishing before 2:15 → grind slightly finer
- If bitter → reduce temperature to 86°C
- If thin/weak → increase dose to 19g or grind finer
- If astringent → temperature is too high

## 🔄 Recipe Variations

**Variations**:
- **Ultra-Smooth Version**: Reduce temp to 86°C, use 1:17 ratio
- **Full Body Version**: Increase dose to 20g, use 1:15 ratio
- **Iced Coffee Version**: Use 1:14 ratio, brew over ice
- **Quick Version**: 3-pour technique (bloom + 2 large pours)

**When to Use Variations**:
- Ultra-smooth: For very dark roasts or to eliminate any bitterness
- Full body: When you want maximum richness
- Iced: Hot summer days (dark roasts great for iced coffee)
- Quick: Morning rush

**Alternative Ratios**:
- 1:15 (stronger, richer body)
- 1:16 (standard, balanced)
- 1:17 (lighter, smoother)

**Alternative Temperatures**:
- 86°C (for very dark roasts)
- 88°C (standard)
- 90°C (for medium-dark roasts)

**Winter Version**: Increase dose to 19g for stronger winter brew

**Summer Version**: Use 1:17 ratio for lighter brew, excellent for iced coffee

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Critical**: Lower temperature (88°C or below) prevents over-extraction
- Coarser grind than usual for dark roasts
- Don't over-preheat equipment - moderate warmth is fine
- Minimal agitation - dark roasts extract quickly
- Shorter brew time acceptable (2:15-2:30)
- Dark roasts have less density - expect faster drawdown
- Enjoy the chocolate and nutty notes without bitterness

**Common Mistakes**:
- Using water too hot (>90°C) - creates bitterness
- Grinding too fine - over-extracts and creates bitterness
- Over-agitating - increases extraction
- Extended brew time - leads to over-extraction
- Not adjusting for dark roast characteristics

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Bitter**: Lower temperature, coarser grind, shorter brew
- **Too Weak**: Increase dose, grind slightly finer, increase temperature to 90°C
- **Lacks Body**: Increase dose, decrease ratio to 1:15
- **Astringent**: Lower temperature significantly (86°C)
- **Tastes Burnt**: Can't fix burnt beans, but lower temp helps

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Bitterness**: This is the main issue with dark roasts - lower temp and coarser grind
- **Channeling**: Improve grind distribution
- **Too Thin**: Increase dose or grind finer
- **Oily Residue**: Normal for dark roasts, use fresh filters

## 📝 Notes

This V60 recipe is specifically designed for dark roast Brazilian coffees, which require lower temperatures and coarser grinds to avoid over-extraction and bitterness. The key is brewing at 88°C or below.

Dark roasted coffee has lower density and extracts more easily, so this recipe uses coarser grind, lower temperature, and shorter brew time compared to light roast recipes.

Works exceptionally well with:
- Brazilian natural dark roasts (best match)
- Brazilian pulped natural dark roasts (excellent)
- Brazilian Santos dark roast (excellent)
- Any dark roasted coffee that needs smoothness

**Key Insight**: Temperature is the most critical variable for dark roasts. When in doubt, lower the temperature rather than adjusting grind size first.
