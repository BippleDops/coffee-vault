## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 96°C (will drop to 94°C)
   - Weigh 20g coffee beans
   - Grind to medium (23 clicks Comandante)
   - Place Kalita Wave filter in brewer
   - **Rinse filter** thoroughly with hot water
   - Discard rinse water
   - Place Kalita on server/mug
   - Add ground coffee to filter
   - Gently shake to level coffee bed
   - Tare scale

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Pour 60g water (3x dose) in gentle spiral
   - Start from center, work outward
   - Ensure complete saturation
   - Gentle swirl of brewer
   - Wait until 0:45

3. **First Pour** (0:45 - 1:20)
   - Pour to 150g total (90g water added)
   - Slow, steady spiral pour
   - Pour in center and outward circles
   - Avoid pouring on filter walls
   - Maintain steady flow
   - Complete by 1:20

4. **Second Pour** (1:20 - 2:00)
   - Pour to 240g total (90g water added)
   - Same spiral technique
   - Center to outer circles
   - Complete by 2:00

5. **Final Pour** (2:00 - 2:30)
   - Pour to 300g total (60g water added)
   - Gentle center pour
   - Complete by 2:30

6. **Drawdown** (2:30 - 3:15)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 2:45-3:15
   - Flat bed should form naturally
   - This is key Kalita advantage

7. **Finish** (3:00)
   - Remove Kalita
   - Swirl coffee gently
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Steady spiral from center outward
**Agitation Method**: Gentle swirl after bloom, minimal during pours
**Pour Velocity**: Moderate (aim for ~8-10g/second)
**Flat Bed**: Forms naturally due to three-hole design
**Target Bed Appearance**: Perfectly flat bed (easier than V60)

**Kalita Advantages**:
- Three holes create more even flow than single hole
- Flat bed forms naturally
- More forgiving than V60
- More consistent results
- Less technique-dependent

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.30-1.40%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 20-22%
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Balanced, clean, consistent

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 2:30-3:30
- Perfectly flat bed (forms easily)
- Minimal channeling
- Balanced, clean cup
- Consistent results batch to batch

**Signs of Success**:
- Even bloom
- Steady drawdown
- Naturally flat bed
- Clean, balanced cup
- Repeatable results
- No channeling

**Signs of Failure**:
- Fast drawdown (<2:30) - grind finer
- Slow drawdown (>3:45) - grind coarser
- Uneven bed - improve pour distribution
- Bitter taste - lower temp or coarser grind
- Weak taste - grind finer

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If finishing before 2:30 → grind finer
- If still draining after 3:30 → grind coarser
- If inconsistent results → check pour technique
- If bitter → lower temperature

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Flat bed is automatic** - Kalita's three-hole design makes this easy
- More forgiving than V60 - easier to get consistent results
- Level coffee bed before brewing (gentle shake)
- Rinse filter thoroughly - removes paper taste
- Gentle spiral pours work best
- Don't pour on filter walls - reduces channeling
- Perfect for beginners learning pour-over
- Excellent for batch brewing (up to 30g dose)
- Very consistent results - great for dialing in new coffees

**Common Mistakes**:
- Pouring on filter walls - causes channeling
- Not leveling bed before brewing - uneven extraction
- Skipping filter rinse - papery taste
- Grinding same as V60 - should be slightly coarser
- Over-agitating - Kalita needs less agitation than V60

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: Grind finer, increase dose, or hotter water
- **Too Bitter**: Coarser grind, lower temperature
- **Inconsistent**: Focus on consistent pour technique
- **Too Fast**: Grind finer
- **Too Slow**: Grind coarser

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Channeling**: Level bed, don't pour on walls
- **Uneven Extraction**: Improve pour distribution
- **Bitter**: Lower temperature or coarser grind
- **Weak**: Finer grind or more coffee

## 📝 Notes

The Kalita Wave is the consistency champion of pour-over methods. Its three-hole flat-bed design creates more even extraction than single-hole drippers, making it more forgiving and consistent. Perfect for beginners and batch brewing.

**Kalita Philosophy**:
Kalita Wave was designed to solve V60's consistency challenges. The flat bed and three holes create more even flow and extraction. It's the pour-over method that's easiest to master while still producing excellent coffee.

**Kalita vs V60**:
- **Kalita Advantages**: More consistent, easier flat bed, more forgiving, better for batches
- **V60 Advantages**: Slightly more clarity possible, faster brewing, more control for experts
- **When to Use Kalita**: Consistency priority, batch brewing, learning pour-over
- **When to Use V60**: Maximum clarity, single servings, when technique mastered

**Best Use Cases**:
- Learning pour-over technique (excellent)
- Batch brewing 2-4 cups (perfect)
- Consistent daily brewing (excellent)
- Coffee shops (many prefer Kalita for consistency)
- Dialing in new coffees (forgiving)

**Perfect Coffees for Kalita**:
- Literally any coffee - Kalita is universally compatible
- Excellent for balanced, medium roasts
- Very good for light roasts
- Good for showcasing complexity

**Barista Favorite**:
Many professional baristas prefer Kalita for batch brew service because it's more consistent than V60. When you're making 20+ brews per day, consistency matters more than absolute peak performance.

**Wave Filters**:
The wavy Kalita filters are essential to the brewing method. They create air channels between filter and brewer, promoting even flow. Don't substitute with flat filters - defeats the design.

**Size Options**:
- Kalita Wave 155: 1-2 cups (15g coffee max)
- Kalita Wave 185: 2-4 cups (30g coffee max) - this recipe
- Choose 185 for versatility
