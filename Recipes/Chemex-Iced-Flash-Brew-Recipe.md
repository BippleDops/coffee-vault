## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water to 97°C (will drop to 96°C)
   - Weigh 50g coffee beans
   - Weigh 250g ice into Chemex
   - Grind coffee to medium
   - Open Chemex filter (3 layers on spout side)
   - Place filter in Chemex (above ice)
   - **Rinse filter thoroughly** with hot water
   - Discard rinse water, keeping ice in Chemex
   - Add ground coffee to filter
   - Tare scale with Chemex (ice + coffee)

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Pour 120g hot water (2.4x dose) in spiral
   - Ensure complete saturation
   - Gentle swirl of Chemex
   - Wait until 0:45
   - Ice begins melting during bloom

3. **First Pour** (0:45 - 1:45)
   - Pour to 280g total hot water (160g added)
   - Slow, controlled spiral from center outward
   - Maintain steady, slow pour (Chemex pace)
   - Complete by 1:45
   - Coffee drips onto ice, flash-chilling

4. **Second Pour** (1:45 - 3:00)
   - Pour to 420g total hot water (140g added)
   - Same slow, controlled spiral
   - Patience - Chemex rewards slow pours
   - Complete by 3:00
   - Ice rapidly melting and chilling coffee

5. **Final Pour** (3:00 - 4:00)
   - Pour to 500g total hot water (80g added)
   - Maintain gentle spiral
   - Complete by 4:00
   - This is final hot water addition

6. **Drawdown** (4:00 - 5:30)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target completion: 5:00-5:30
   - Coffee continues dripping onto ice
   - Ice should be 75-90% melted by completion
   - Beautiful to watch - coffee chilling as it brews

7. **Finish** (5:00-5:30)
   - Remove filter and grounds
   - Add fresh ice to Chemex if desired
   - Swirl Chemex to ensure even cooling
   - Should have ~700-750ml iced coffee
   - Serve immediately over ice

8. **Serve for Entertaining**
   - Pour over ice-filled glasses
   - Garnish if desired (orange peel for Ethiopian)
   - Serve with simple syrup on side (optional)
   - Enjoy ultra-clean, aromatic iced coffee

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Same as hot Chemex - slow, controlled spirals
**Flash Chilling**: Coffee drops directly onto ice, instant cooling preserves aromatics
**Ice Quality**: Use filtered water ice for best taste
**Temperature**: High temp (96°C) compensates for ice dilution
**Batch Brewing**: Chemex excels for entertaining - makes 6-8 servings

**Key Differences from Hot Chemex**:
- Ice in Chemex before brewing
- High water temperature (96°C)
- Less total hot water (ice makes up difference)
- Filter goes above ice
- Faster consumption (don't let sit long)

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **High temperature critical** - 96-97°C compensates for ice dilution
- Use filtered water for ice - ice quality affects taste significantly
- Chemex's thick filters create exceptionally clean iced coffee
- Perfect for entertaining - makes 6-8 servings at once
- Serve within 2 hours for best quality (longer is okay, but peaks fresh)
- Ethiopian coffees make phenomenal iced coffee this way
- Orange peel garnish complements Ethiopian naturals beautifully
- Much better than brewing hot and refrigerating (no oxidation)
- Weigh ice accurately - determines final strength
- Impressive presentation - guests can watch brewing process

**Entertaining Tips**:
- Make ahead: Can refrigerate covered up to 24 hours
- Serve with simple syrup on side (let guests sweeten)
- Provide fresh ice for serving glasses
- Garnish options: citrus peel, herbs, edible flowers
- Label coffee origin and flavor notes
- This impresses coffee enthusiasts and casual drinkers equally

**Common Mistakes**:
- Using water too cool (<95°C) - creates weak, under-extracted iced coffee
- Too much ice - overly diluted
- Too little ice - strong and quickly warming
- Low-quality ice - affects taste significantly
- Grinding same as hot Chemex - should be slightly coarser
- Letting sit too long before serving - best fresh

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Weak**: Reduce ice to 200g OR increase coffee to 55g
- **Too Strong**: Increase ice to 300g OR reduce coffee to 45g
- **Flat/Lifeless**: Increase temperature to 97°C, ensure flash cooling
- **Bitter**: Grind coarser or lower temperature
- **Ice Not Fully Melted**: Reduce ice amount or increase water temperature

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Ice Doesn't Melt Enough**: Too much ice or water too cool
- **Weak Coffee**: Not enough coffee, too much ice, or underextracted
- **Oxidized Taste**: This shouldn't happen with flash brew - check technique
- **Bitter**: Over-extracted - coarser grind or lower temp

## 📝 Notes

Chemex iced coffee combines two specialty coffee strengths: Chemex's exceptional clarity and flash brew's aromatic preservation. The result is ultra-clean, bright iced coffee perfect for entertaining. This is summer coffee party brewing.

**Why Chemex for Iced Coffee**:
1. **Batch brewing**: Makes 6-8 servings (perfect for entertaining)
2. **Ultra-clean**: Thick filters create exceptionally clean iced coffee
3. **Beautiful presentation**: Chemex is elegant, brewing process is theatrical
4. **Clarity**: Showcases bright, complex coffees beautifully
5. **Aromatic**: Flash cooling preserves volatile aromatics better than cold brew

**Chemex Iced vs Cold Brew**:
- **Chemex Iced**: Bright, aromatic, complex, fast (5 minutes)
- **Cold Brew**: Smooth, mellow, low-acid, slow (12-24 hours)
- **When Chemex Iced**: Entertaining, bright coffees, same-day brewing
- **When Cold Brew**: Make ahead, smooth/low-acid preference, convenience

**Best Coffees for Chemex Iced**:
1. **Ethiopian Natural** (fruit bomb iced coffee)
2. **Ethiopian Washed** (floral, bright, clean)
3. **Kenyan** (complex, bright, intense)
4. **Central American** (balanced, approachable)
5. **Any bright, aromatic coffee**

**Entertaining Strategy**:
This is perfect summer entertaining brewing method:
- Makes 6-8 servings at once
- Beautiful brewing presentation (Chemex is elegant)
- Impresses guests (flash brew is interesting)
- Ultra-clean, aromatic result
- Can make ahead (stays good 24 hours refrigerated)
- Versatile (some guests add milk, others drink black)

**Cost per Serving**:
- 50g coffee ($3-5 for specialty beans)
- Makes 6-8 servings
- Cost per serving: $0.40-0.80
- vs Cafe iced coffee: $4-6 per serving
- Savings: 80-90% vs cafés

**Seasonal Timing**:
Perfect for:
- Summer afternoon gatherings
- Brunch entertaining
- Outdoor parties
- Coffee tastings (showcase multiple origins iced)
- Hot weather entertaining

**Technical Note**:
Flash brew (hot coffee over ice) preserves volatile aromatic compounds that are lost in cold brew's long, cold extraction. This is why flash brew iced coffee tastes brighter and more complex than cold brew. Both have their place, but flash brew is superior for aromatic, complex coffees.

**Storage**:
Fresh is best, but can refrigerate covered up to 24 hours. Beyond 24 hours, oxidation begins affecting flavor. Don't store longer than 48 hours.

**Perfect for**: Summer entertaining, showcasing exceptional light roasts, impressing coffee enthusiast guests, coffee parties, afternoon gatherings.
