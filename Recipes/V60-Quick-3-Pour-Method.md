## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Detailed Steps (3-Pour Method)

1. **Preparation** (0:00)
   - Boil water (let cool to ~93°C if no temp control)
   - Weigh coffee (15g for single cup, 20g for large)
   - Grind to medium (standard filter setting)
   - Rinse V60 filter with hot water
   - Preheat V60 and server quickly
   - Tare scale with V60 and coffee

2. **Bloom** (0:00 - 0:45)
   - Start timer
   - Add 2-3x dose water (30-50g for 15g dose)
   - Ensure all grounds saturated
   - Gentle swirl
   - Wait until 0:45

3. **Main Pour** (0:45 - 1:45)
   - Pour to 60% of total (150g for 250g recipe)
   - Steady spiral pour from center outward
   - Don't need perfect technique - just steady
   - Complete by 1:45
   - This is the main extraction pour

4. **Final Pour** (1:45 - 2:15)
   - Pour remaining water to total (250g)
   - Center pour or continued spiral
   - Complete by 2:15
   - This tops off and rinses the bed

5. **Drawdown** (2:15 - 2:45)
   - Allow complete drawdown
   - Target: 2:30-2:45 total
   - Should be mostly drained by 2:30
   - Remove V60 at 2:45 even if still dripping slightly

6. **Finish** (2:45)
   - Remove V60
   - Quick swirl of server
   - Serve immediately

### Technique Notes

**Pour Technique**: Steady spiral or center pour - doesn't need to be perfect
**Agitation Method**: Gentle swirl after bloom, that's it
**Pour Velocity**: Moderate - don't overthink it
**Target Bed Appearance**: Relatively flat bed (doesn't need to be perfect)

**Key Simplifications**:
- Only 3 pours instead of 4-5
- Larger pours = less precision required
- Forgiving time windows
- Don't need perfect spiral pours
- Works with standard equipment

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- **Target TDS**: 1.30-1.40%
- **Target Extraction Yield**: 19-21%
- **Target Strength**: Medium-bodied
- **Target Flavor Profile**: Clean, balanced, good extraction

**Success Criteria**:
- Brew time between 2:15-3:00
- Relatively flat coffee bed
- Clean-tasting cup
- No major off-flavors

**Signs of Success**:
- Reasonable bloom
- Steady drawdown
- Clean-tasting cup
- Good flavor extraction
- Consistent results

**Signs of Failure**:
- Very fast drawdown (<2:00) - grind finer
- Very slow drawdown (>3:30) - grind coarser
- Bitter taste - lower temperature or grind coarser
- Weak taste - grind finer or increase dose

**Troubleshooting Cues**:
- If too fast → grind finer
- If too slow → grind coarser
- If bitter → lower temp or coarser grind
- If weak → grind finer or more coffee

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

**Tips**:
- **Speed is the point** - don't overthink technique
- Use consistent dose and grind for repeatability
- Medium grind is most forgiving
- If unsure about temp, use 93°C (universal)
- Scale works well (15g to 30g range)
- Great for weekday mornings
- Achieves 85-90% of advanced method quality
- Much more consistent than complex methods for beginners
- Pour at comfortable speed - doesn't need to be precise

**Common Mistakes**:
- Overthinking technique - this is supposed to be simple
- Grinding too fine - creates over-extraction
- Using water too hot for dark roasts
- Not maintaining consistent dose and grind
- Expecting perfection - this is a practical method

**Adjustment Guide**:
- **Too Bitter**: Lower temperature, coarser grind
- **Too Weak**: Grind finer, increase dose slightly
- **Inconsistent Results**: Keep dose and grind consistent
- **Too Slow**: Grind coarser
- **Too Fast**: Grind finer

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Bitter/Over-extracted**: Coarser grind or lower temp
- **Weak/Under-extracted**: Finer grind or hotter water
- **Inconsistent**: Focus on consistent dose and grind size
- **Channeling**: Ensure even saturation during bloom
