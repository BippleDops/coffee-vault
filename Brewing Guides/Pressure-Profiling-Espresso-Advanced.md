# ☕ Pressure Profiling - Advanced Espresso

**Method**: Pressure Profiling  
**Difficulty**: Expert  
**Equipment**: Pressure-Profiling Capable Machine  
**Best For**: Advanced Espresso Optimization, Light Roasts

---

## 📋 Overview

Pressure profiling is espresso's advanced frontier - varying brew pressure throughout shot (vs. constant 9 bars) to optimize extraction for specific coffees, enabling gentler extractions for light roasts, more complexity from any bean, and customization impossible with standard espresso.

**What is Pressure Profiling**:
- **Variable Pressure**: Change pressure during shot
- **Profiles**: Pre-infusion low → ramp → decline patterns
- **Advanced**: Requires compatible machine (Decent, Slayer, etc.)
- **Optimization**: Customize extraction for specific coffee
- **Competition**: Used in barista championships

## 🎯 Common Profiles

**Pre-Infusion Profile**:
- 0-5s: 2-4 bars (gentle saturation)
- 5-30s: Ramp to 9 bars (full extraction)
- Result: Even saturation, less channeling

**Declining Profile** (Light Roasts):
- 0-10s: 9 bars (initial extraction)
- 10-30s: Decline to 6 bars (gentle finish)
- Result: Sweetness without over-extraction

**Blooming Profile**:
- Variable pre-infusion, pressure drops, rises
- Result: Enhanced complexity

## 📝 Summary

**Pressure Profiling** is advanced espresso - varying pressure during shot for optimized extraction, gentler light roast brewing, and enhanced complexity through customization.

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Advanced espresso perfection.
