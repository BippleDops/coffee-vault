# ☕ Cold Brew Coffee Guide

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Source**: Multiple specialty coffee resources  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24

---

## 📋 Overview

**Best For**: Hot weather; smooth, low-acid coffee; make-ahead convenience; cold coffee drinks; highlighting chocolate and nutty flavors

Cold brew is coffee steeped in cold or room-temperature water for an extended period (12-24 hours). The result is a smooth, naturally sweet concentrate with low acidity and bitterness. It's incredibly forgiving, can be made in large batches, and stays fresh in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

**Time Required**: 12-24 hours (mostly hands-off)

**Equipment Needed**:
- Large jar, pitcher, or dedicated cold brew maker
- Grinder
- Scale
- Fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth
- Storage container
- Optional: Cold brew maker with built-in filter

## ⚙️ Standard Recipe

### Basic Parameters (1 Liter Concentrate)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coffee Dose | 200g | For concentrate (1:5 ratio) |
| Water | 1000g/ml (1L) | Filtered, room temp or cold |
| Ratio | 1:5 | Makes concentrate to dilute |
| Grind Size | Coarse | Like French Press, chunky |
| Water Temp | Room temp or cold | 68-72°F or fridge temp |
| Steep Time | 16-18 hours | Fridge: 18-24h, Room temp: 12-16h |
| Total Time | ~24 hours | Including prep and filtering |

### Alternative Ratios

- **Strong concentrate (1:4)**: 250g coffee, 1L water → very strong, dilute more
- **Ready-to-drink (1:8)**: 125g coffee, 1L water → drink straight
- **Standard concentrate (1:5)**: 200g coffee, 1L water → balanced, versatile

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation

1. **Choose container** - Glass jar, pitcher, or cold brew maker (1L+ capacity)
2. **Measure coffee** - 200g coarse ground coffee
3. **Add to container** - Pour grounds into vessel

### Brewing Process

1. **Add water**
   - Pour 1L room temperature or cold filtered water
   - Stir gently to ensure all grounds are saturated
   - No dry pockets - all coffee should be wet

2. **Cover and steep**
   - Cover container (lid, plastic wrap, or plate)
   - Choose location:
     - **Room temp (68-72°F)**: 12-16 hours → fuller body, stronger
     - **Refrigerator**: 18-24 hours → cleaner, lighter
   - No stirring needed during steep

3. **Check at minimum time**
   - Taste test at 12 hours (room temp) or 18 hours (fridge)
   - If too weak, continue steeping
   - If strong enough, proceed to filtering

### Filtering

1. **Strain through filter**
   - **Method 1**: Pour through fine-mesh strainer into container
   - **Method 2**: Line strainer with cheesecloth for cleaner brew
   - **Method 3**: Use built-in filter if using dedicated cold brewer
   - Let gravity do the work - takes 10-20 minutes

2. **Second filtration (optional)**
   - For ultra-clean brew
   - Filter again through paper coffee filter
   - Or let settle 30 minutes, pour off clear portion

### Storage

1. **Transfer to clean container**
   - Glass jar or bottle works best
   - Store in refrigerator
   - Keeps for 10-14 days

2. **Label with date**
   - Note brew date
   - Track when to use by

## 🎯 Serving & Dilution

### Serving Ratios (from 1:5 concentrate)

**Classic Iced Coffee**:
- 1 part concentrate : 1 part water or milk
- Example: 100ml concentrate + 100ml water/milk
- Over ice

**Strong Cold Coffee**:
- 2 parts concentrate : 1 part water
- Example: 150ml concentrate + 75ml water
- Over ice

**Latte-Style**:
- 1 part concentrate : 2 parts milk
- Example: 80ml concentrate + 160ml milk
- Over ice

**Straight/Undiluted**:
- If made with 1:8 ratio initially
- Pour over ice, drink as-is
- Very smooth, not overwhelming

### Serving Ideas

**Classic Iced Coffee**: Concentrate + water + ice + simple syrup (optional)

**Cold Brew Latte**: Concentrate + milk (any type) + ice

**Vietnamese-Style**: Concentrate + sweetened condensed milk + ice

**Tonic Cold Brew**: Concentrate + tonic water + ice + citrus (trendy!)

**Nitro-Style**: Concentrate served from nitro tap or whipped cream dispenser

**Hot Americano**: Concentrate + hot water (yes, you can serve hot!)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Too weak | Ratio too diluted, steep too short, grind too coarse | Use 1:4 ratio, steep longer (20-24h), grind slightly finer |
| Too bitter | Over-extracted, steep too long, grind too fine | Steep 12-16h max, coarser grind, use fridge not room temp |
| Sour taste | Under-extracted, steep too short | Steep longer (18-20h), use room temp not fridge |
| Muddy/gritty | Grind too fine, poor filtration | Coarser grind, double-filter with cheesecloth |
| Weak flavor | Old coffee, too much dilution | Fresh coffee (2-4 weeks off roast), less dilution |
| Tastes sour after 5 days | Starting to ferment | Make smaller batches, keep fridge <40°F, use within 2 weeks |

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Toddy System Method (Original Cold Brew)

1. Use Toddy cold brew maker
2. 340g coffee, 2L water
3. Brew in specialized container with filter
4. 12-18 hours at room temp
5. Produces smooth, classic concentrate

### Japanese Iced Coffee Alternative (Flash Brew)

Not technically cold brew, but related:
1. Brew hot V60 directly onto ice
2. Hot extraction + immediate cooling
3. Brighter, more acidic than cold brew
4. Takes 3 minutes vs 24 hours

### Nitrogen Infusion

1. Make standard cold brew concentrate
2. Transfer to whipped cream dispenser
3. Add 1 N2O cartridge
4. Shake and serve
5. Creamy, cascading effect like Guinness

### Coffee Ice Cubes

1. Make cold brew
2. Pour into ice cube trays
3. Freeze
4. Use in iced coffee - doesn't dilute!

### Flavor Infusions

Add to grounds during steeping:
- **Vanilla**: 1 vanilla bean, split
- **Cinnamon**: 2-3 cinnamon sticks
- **Cardamom**: 10-12 pods, crushed
- **Orange**: Peel from 1 orange (avoid pith)
- **Cocoa**: 2 tablespoons cocoa nibs

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

**For Better Results**:
- Use coarse grind - reduces bitterness and over-extraction
- Stir well initially - ensures even saturation
- Room temperature extracts more (faster, fuller) than fridge
- Use fresh coffee (1-4 weeks off roast)
- Filtered water makes cleaner-tasting brew
- Let steep at least 12 hours - patience is key

**Scaling Up & Down**:
- **Small batch (500ml)**: 100g coffee, 500ml water
- **Medium batch (1L)**: 200g coffee, 1L water
- **Large batch (2L)**: 400g coffee, 2L water
- **Party size (4L)**: 800g coffee, 4L water

**Best Beans for Cold Brew**:
- Medium to dark roasts work wonderfully
- Chocolate and nut profiles shine
- Brazilian, Colombian coffees excellent
- Natural process adds fruity sweetness
- Blends often better than single origins
- Affordable coffee works well (smooth method forgives)

**Money-Saving Tips**:
- Cold brew is very forgiving - use affordable coffee
- Buy in bulk and freeze
- Make large batches - lasts 2 weeks
- Cheaper than buying bottled cold brew
- One batch = 8-10 servings

## 💭 Personal Notes & Modifications

**What I've Learned**:
- Patience is rewarded - minimum 16 hours for best results
- Room temperature brewing is faster and fuller-bodied
- Filtration matters - double filtering makes huge difference
- Stays fresh way longer than I expected (10+ days)
- Incredibly cost-effective vs buying bottled

**My Preferred Variations**:
- **Summer batch**: 300g medium roast, 1.5L water, 18h fridge, makes 2 weeks supply
- **Quick version**: 150g fine grind, 750ml water, 4h room temp, strain (not ideal but works)
- **Vanilla cold brew**: Add 2 vanilla beans to standard recipe

**Next Experiments**:
- Try different origins side-by-side
- Experiment with hot water bloom before cold steep
- Test agitation (stirring every 6 hours)
- Make coffee concentrate ice cubes
- Try coconut cold brew (coconut water instead of regular)
