# 🍜 Soup Shot Espresso Guide

**Long, low-temperature extractions for ultra-sweet, low-acidity espresso**

---

## What is a Soup Shot?

Soup shots (also called "allongé" or "long shots") are an advanced espresso technique featuring:
- **Finer grind** than traditional espresso
- **Lower temperature** (88-91°C vs 93-96°C)
- **Extended extraction time** (35-60+ seconds)
- **Higher yield** (1:3-1:4 ratio or more)
- **Very low pressure** (optional: 3-6 bar)

**Result**: Ultra-sweet, syrupy, low-acid espresso with chocolate/caramel notes and velvety body.

**Origin**: Italian "lungo" tradition, refined by modern specialty coffee

## Target Parameters

| Parameter | Traditional | Soup Shot |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Dose** | 18-20g | 18-22g |
| **Yield** | 36-40g | 54-80g |
| **Time** | 25-30s | 40-70s |
| **Ratio** | 1:2 | 1:3-1:4 |
| **Grind** | Fine | Extra-fine to fine |
| **Pressure** | 9 bar | 3-6 bar (or 9 bar) |
| **Temperature** | 93-96°C | 88-91°C |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.5 g/s | 0.8-1.2 g/s |

## Why Soup Shots Work

### The Science
- **Lower temperature** → reduced acid extraction
- **Extended time** → more sugar dissolution
- **Fine grind** → higher surface area
- **High yield** → continued sweet extraction

### Flavor Chemistry
1. **Acids extract first** (fast, high temp)
2. **Sugars extract slower** (longer time needed)
3. **Bitters extract last** (very long or very hot)

**Soup shots target the sweet middle ground**: enough time for sugars, low enough temp to minimize acids.

## Step-by-Step Recipe

### Equipment Needed
- Espresso machine with **temperature control** (essential)
- Grinder with fine adjustments
- Precision scale (0.1g)
- Timer
- Optional: Pressure profiling capability

### Basic Soup Shot Recipe

**Target**: 20g in → 60g out in 50-60 seconds at 90°C

#### Step 1: Temperature Setup
1. **Lower your machine** to 88-90°C
2. Let stabilize for 5-10 minutes
3. Flush group head before pulling

#### Step 2: Grind Adjustment
1. Start finer than traditional espresso
2. Aim for powder-like consistency
3. Fine as Turkish coffee or slightly coarser

#### Step 3: Dose & Distribution
1. Dose: **20g** (±0.3g)
2. WDT (Weiss Distribution) - **essential!**
3. Careful distribution prevents channeling
4. Level meticulously

#### Step 4: Tamp
1. Very firm, even tamp
2. Polish to seal
3. Clean basket edges

#### Step 5: Extraction
1. Lock portafilter
2. Start timer
3. **Target flow**:
   - First drops: 8-12 seconds
   - Thin stream: 15-20 seconds
   - Yield 30g: ~30 seconds
   - Yield 60g: 50-60 seconds

#### Step 6: Stop Point
- **Traditional stop**: When blonde (60-70g)
- **Conservative**: At 60g (1:3)
- **Extended**: Up to 80g (1:4) for ultra-sweet

## Flavor Profile Expectations

### Perfect Soup Shot
- ✅ **Very sweet** (caramel, honey, chocolate)
- ✅ **Low acidity** (smooth, mellow)
- ✅ **Syrupy body** (thick mouthfeel)
- ✅ **Long finish** (lingers pleasantly)
- ✅ **No sourness** (properly extracted)

### Common Flavor Notes
- Milk chocolate, dark chocolate
- Caramel, toffee, brown sugar
- Hazelnut, almond
- Vanilla, honey
- Molasses, maple syrup

---

## Troubleshooting

### Too Bitter/Astringent
**Cause**: Over-extraction, temperature too high
**Fix**:
- Lower temp to 88-89°C
- Stop extraction earlier (55g instead of 60g)
- Ensure puck isn't channeling

### Too Sour/Sharp
**Cause**: Under-extraction, channeling
**Fix**:
- Grind finer
- Improve puck prep (WDT essential)
- Increase temperature to 90-91°C
- Extend extraction time

### Watery/Thin
**Cause**: Too much yield, channeling
**Fix**:
- Reduce yield to 1:3 ratio (60g for 20g dose)
- Grind finer
- Better distribution
- Firmer tamp

### Channeling (Fast Shot)
**Cause**: Uneven puck, grind too coarse
**Fix**:
- Use WDT tool (mandatory for soup shots)
- Grind finer
- Ensure level tamp
- Check basket for cleanliness

## Advanced Techniques

### Pressure Profiling for Soup Shots

**Optimal Profile**:
1. **Preinfusion**: 10s at 2 bar (wets puck gently)
2. **Ramp**: Slow rise to 4-6 bar over 10s
3. **Hold**: Maintain 4-6 bar for 30-40s
4. **Total**: 50-60s

**Why Low Pressure?**
- Reduces channeling risk
- Allows finer grind without stalling
- Increases extraction uniformity

### Temperature Stepping

For machines with PID control:
1. Start at 91°C for first 20g
2. Drop to 89°C for remaining extraction
3. Minimizes early acid, maximizes late sweetness

### The "Blooming" Technique
1. Pull to 20g (preinfuse + 10s)
2. **Stop** for 10-15 seconds
3. Resume to full 60g
4. **Result**: Enhanced sweetness, body

## Bean Selection

### Best Beans for Soup Shots
1. **Medium to dark roasts** - Chocolate, caramel notes
2. **Natural processed** - Berry sweetness amplified
3. **Brazilian, Colombian** - Nutty, chocolatey
4. **Aged/monsooned** - Low acid, sweet

### Beans to Avoid
- Very light roasts (can taste sour)
- High-acid origins initially (until technique refined)
- Robusta blends (can be harsh with long extraction)

### Roast Development
- **City to Full City**: Ideal range
- **Well-developed**: More sweetness
- **Avoid**: Under-developed or ultra-dark roasts

## Milk Drinks with Soup Shots

Soup shots excel in milk beverages:

**Cappuccino**:
- Ultra-sweet base
- Chocolate notes complement milk
- Less acidity = smoother drinks

**Latte**:
- Syrupy body carries through milk
- Needs less/no sweetener
- Excellent for latte art (thick crema)

**Cortado**:
- Perfect for showcasing sweetness
- Balances milk ratio beautifully

**Recommendation**: 1:3 ratio (20g → 60g) for milk drinks

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Temperature Too High
- **Result**: Bitter, acidic
- **Fix**: Must use 88-91°C range

### ❌ Poor Puck Prep
- **Result**: Channeling, sour
- **Fix**: WDT is non-negotiable for soup shots

### ❌ Wrong Grind Direction
- **Result**: Sour if too coarse
- **Fix**: Go finer than you think

### ❌ Stopping Too Early
- **Result**: Sour, thin
- **Fix**: Commit to 1:3-1:4 ratio

### ❌ Using Wrong Beans
- **Result**: Bright light roasts taste off
- **Fix**: Use medium-dark roasts initially
