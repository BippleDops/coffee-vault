# ☕ Chemex Brewing Guide

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Source**: Chemex official + specialty coffee resources  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24

---

## 📋 Overview

**Best For**: Clean, tea-like coffee; highlighting delicate flavors; brewing for 2-4 people; showcasing light-roasted single origins; elegant presentation

The Chemex is an iconic hourglass-shaped pour-over brewer invented in 1941 by Dr. Peter Schlumbohm. Its thick proprietary filters (20-30% heavier than standard) produce an exceptionally clean cup by removing oils and fine particles. The result is a tea-like, clarity-focused brew that highlights acidity and delicate flavors.

**Time Required**: 4-5 minutes

**Equipment Needed**:
- Chemex brewer (3-cup, 6-cup, or 8-cup)
- Chemex bonded filters (white or natural)
- Gooseneck kettle
- Grinder
- Scale
- Timer

## ⚙️ Standard Recipe

### Basic Parameters (6-Cup Chemex)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coffee Dose | 42g | For 700ml water (scale proportionally) |
| Water | 700g/ml | Final brew weight |
| Ratio | 1:16.6 | Same as V60, produces clean cup |
| Grind Size | Medium-coarse | Coarser than V60 due to thick filter |
| Water Temp | 200-205°F / 93-96°C | Slightly hotter than V60 |
| Total Time | 4:00-4:30 | Slower than V60 due to thick filter |

### Scaling for Different Sizes

- **3-cup Chemex**: 25g coffee, 420ml water
- **6-cup Chemex**: 42g coffee, 700ml water
- **8-cup Chemex**: 50g coffee, 850ml water
- **10-cup Chemex**: 65g coffee, 1100ml water

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation

1. **Fold filter properly**
   - Unfold filter, create cone
   - **Critical**: 3-layer side faces spout
   - Creates air channel for proper drainage
   - 1-layer side faces back

2. **Place in Chemex**
   - Insert filter with 3 layers over spout
   - Ensure even fit all around

3. **Rinse filter thoroughly**
   - Use 200°F water, rinse entire filter
   - Removes paper taste
   - Preheats Chemex
   - Critical: Rinse more than V60 (thicker filter)

4. **Discard rinse water**
   - Pour out, keeping filter in place
   - Place Chemex on scale, tare

5. **Add coffee**
   - 42g medium-coarse grind
   - Create flat bed by gentle shaking

### Brewing Process

1. **0:00 - Bloom**
   - Start timer
   - Pour 80-90g water (2x coffee weight)
   - Spiral from center outward
   - Ensure all grounds saturated
   - Gentle swirl to even bed
   - Wait until 0:45

2. **0:45 - First Main Pour**
   - Pour in slow, steady spiral to 350g (half total water)
   - Pour from center, spiral outward, back to center
   - Keep water level 3/4 up the grounds (don't overfill)
   - Pour rate: ~8-10g/second

3. **1:30 - Second Main Pour**
   - Pour to 550g
   - Continue spiral pattern
   - Maintain consistent height in brewer

4. **2:15 - Final Pour**
   - Pour to 700g total
   - Spiral pattern, even coverage
   - All water should be added by 2:30

5. **2:30-4:00 - Drawdown**
   - Allow coffee to drain completely
   - Do NOT stir during drawdown (unlike some V60 methods)
   - Should finish around 4:00-4:30

### Finishing

1. **Remove filter**
   - Lift filter and discard
   - Grounds should form even, flat bed
   - If cone-shaped or uneven → pour pattern needs adjustment

2. **Swirl Chemex**
   - Gentle swirl to integrate brew
   - Aerates slightly

3. **Serve**
   - Pour into cups
   - Chemex doubles as elegant serving carafe
   - Can leave on table for refills

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

**For Better Extraction**:
- Grind coarser than V60 (thicker filter requires coarser)
- Hotter water than V60 (filter absorbs heat)
- Slow, steady pours (rushing creates uneven extraction)
- Center-focused pours for higher extraction
- Avoid pouring on sides/filter (water bypass)
- Swirl after bloom (even saturation)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Grind too fine → Very slow drawdown (6+ minutes), over-extracted, bitter
- Not rinsing filter thoroughly → Papery taste
- 3-layer side not over spout → Poor drainage, slow brew
- Pouring too fast → Channeling, uneven extraction
- Overfilling → Spills, coffee sits too high
- Cheap knockoff filters → Different thickness, inconsistent results

**Filter Orientation is CRITICAL**:
- 3 layers must face spout (creates air channel)
- 1 layer faces back
- Wrong orientation = slow/stuck drawdown

**Adjustments for Different Beans**:
- **Light roasts**: Hotter water (205°F), slightly finer grind, longer time
- **Medium roasts**: Standard recipe works well
- **Dark roasts**: Cooler water (195-200°F), coarser grind (avoid bitterness)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Too bitter | Over-extraction, too fine, too hot | Grind coarser, lower temp to 195-200°F |
| Too sour/acidic | Under-extraction, too coarse, too cool | Grind finer, increase temp to 205°F |
| Weak/watery | Grind too coarse, fast brew | Grind finer, slow down pours |
| Muddy (unusual for Chemex) | Grind too fine, filter issue | Grind coarser, check filter orientation |
| Very slow (6+ min) | Grind way too fine | Grind much coarser, like French Press size |
| Very fast (<3 min) | Grind too coarse | Grind finer, more like pour-over |
| Papery taste | Filter not rinsed enough | Rinse thoroughly with 500ml+ hot water |
| Stalling/not draining | Wrong filter orientation | 3 layers MUST face spout |

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### James Hoffmann Ultimate Chemex

1. 30g coffee, 500g water (1:16.6 ratio)
2. Medium-coarse grind
3. 60g bloom (2x coffee), swirl, wait 30-45 seconds
4. Pour to 300g by 1:15
5. Pour to 500g by 2:00
6. One more swirl at end
7. Should finish by 4:00-4:30

**Result**: Clean, sweet, balanced

### Iced Chemex (Japanese Method)

**Ratio**: 1:13-1:14 (accounts for ice dilution)

1. Add 300g ice to Chemex
2. Use 42g coffee
3. Brew with 400g hot water only
4. Coffee drips onto ice, chilling instantly
5. Result: 700g iced coffee

**Advantage**: Bright, crisp, better than cold brew for certain beans

### Concentrate Brew

**For Milk Drinks**:
1. Use 1:10 ratio (50g coffee, 500g water)
2. Slightly finer grind
3. Creates concentrate
4. Cut with milk or hot water
5. Lattes without espresso machine

## 🧪 The Science of Chemex

### Why It's So Clean

**Thick Filter**:
- 20-30% heavier than standard paper
- Removes cafestol and kahweol (coffee oils)
- Filters fine particles completely
- Creates nearly sediment-free cup

**Health Aspect**:
- Paper filters remove diterpenes (cafestol, kahweol)
- These compounds can raise cholesterol
- Chemex (and other paper filters) = healthier for daily consumption
- Metal filters (French Press) retain these compounds

### Extraction Dynamics

**Slower Flow**:
- Thick filter creates resistance
- Longer contact time than V60
- Requires coarser grind to compensate
- Even slight overgrinding causes dramatic slowdown

**Temperature Retention**:
- Glass conducts heat away
- Filter absorbs heat
- Water cools more than V60
- Requires hotter starting temperature

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

**Filter Tips**:
- **White vs Natural**: White (bleached) slightly cleaner, natural (unbleached) eco-friendly
- Use only Chemex-branded filters for consistency
- Fold properly every time (3 layers toward spout!)
- Buy in bulk (100-count boxes cheaper)
- Store filters in dry place

**Grind Size Guidance**:
- Slightly coarser than table salt
- Finer than French Press
- If using V60 grind: Go 2-3 steps coarser
- Visual: Should see individual particles, not powder

**Pour Technique**:
- High pours (6-8 inches) = more agitation, higher extraction
- Low pours (close to surface) = gentle, lower extraction
- Center focus = more extraction
- Avoid the walls = less extraction

**Multiple Servings**:
- Chemex excels at brewing for groups
- Make 700ml, serve 2-3 people
- Better than multiple single-serve V60s
- Can keep warm in Chemex if serving slowly

## 💭 Personal Notes & Modifications

**What I've Learned**:
- Filter orientation is critical - spent 10 minutes with stuck brew once!
- Coarser than I thought - medium-coarse, not medium-fine
- Rinse filter MORE than you think - papery taste is real
- Beautiful for entertaining - serves as elegant carafe
- Cleanup is easy - just remove filter and dump

**My Preferred Variations**:
- **Weekend hosting**: 50g coffee, 850ml water, serve 3 people
- **Light Ethiopians**: 205°F water, 42g coffee, 700ml, slow gentle pours
- **Iced Chemex**: 42g coffee, 300g ice, 400g hot water - perfect summer

**Next Experiments**:
- Try different filter brands (able brewing filters)
- Experiment with agitation during bloom
- Test different water temperatures (195-205°F range)
- Compare natural vs white filters blind
- Try lower ratio (1:15) for fuller body

**Ideal Coffees**:
- Light roasted Ethiopians (Yirgacheffe)
- Kenyan (bright, complex acidity)
- Rwandan (tea-like, floral)
- Costa Rican (clean, honey-sweet)
- Any coffee with delicate, complex aromatics

**Works Well**:
- Medium roasts with balanced acidity
- Single origins with clarity
