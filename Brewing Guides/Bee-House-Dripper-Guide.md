# ☕ Bee House Ceramic Dripper Complete Guide

**Method**: Bee House Dripper (Ceramic Wedge Pour-Over)  
**Difficulty**: Beginner-Intermediate  
**Time**: ~3-3:30 minutes  
**Origin**: Japan  
**Best For**: Forgiving pour-over, consistent results, aesthetic appeal

---

## 📋 Overview

The Bee House dripper is Japan's beginner-friendly ceramic pour-over - featuring a wedge shape with two large holes (not one) that creates slower, more forgiving extraction making it easier to achieve good results than V60 while producing cleaner coffee than Clever Dripper. It's the Goldilocks of pour-over - not too fast (V60), not immersion (Clever), just right for consistent quality.

**What Makes Bee House Special**:
- **Two Holes**: Unlike V60 (one hole) or Kalita (three), Bee House has two large holes
- **Forgiving**: Slower flow than V60, harder to mess up
- **Ceramic**: Beautiful, heat-stable, aesthetic appeal
- **Wedge Shape**: Between cone (V60) and flat (Kalita)
- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly, technique-forgiving
- **Consistent**: Repeatable results without expert pouring
- **Affordable**: $20-30 (ceramic quality at accessible price)
- **Uses Standard Filters**: #2 or #4 Melitta filters (cheap, available)

**Bee House vs. Competitors**:
- **vs. V60**: Slower, more forgiving, less technique-dependent, less clarity
- **vs. Kalita Wave**: Faster than Kalita, cheaper filters (standard not proprietary)
- **vs. Clever**: Faster than Clever, cleaner than Clever, less body
- **vs. Chemex**: Smaller batches, faster brewing, similar aesthetic appeal

**Choose Bee House If**:
- Want pour-over but intimidated by V60
- Seeking consistency without mastering technique
- Prefer ceramic aesthetic
- Budget-conscious (cheap standard filters)
- Beginner learning pour-over
