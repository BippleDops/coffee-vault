# ☕ Kalita Wave Complete Brewing Guide

**Method**: Kalita Wave (Flat-Bottom Pour-Over)  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate (Easier than V60, More Forgiving)  
**Time Required**: ~3-4 minutes total  
**Origin**: Japan (Kalita Company)  
**Best For**: Balanced extraction, consistent results, full-bodied pour-over

---

## 📋 Overview

The Kalita Wave is a flat-bottom pour-over brewer from Japan that revolutionized manual brewing by making exceptional coffee more consistent and forgiving than traditional cone-shaped drippers. Its three-hole flat bottom and wave-patterned filter create even extraction and reduce technique-dependence, making it ideal for home brewers seeking café-quality results without extensive practice.

**What Makes Kalita Wave Special**:
- **Flat Bottom**: Three small holes create even, consistent draw-down
- **Wave Filter**: Corrugated sides reduce contact with dripper (air channels)
- **Forgiving**: Less technique-dependent than V60 or Chemex
- **Consistent**: Harder to mess up, repeatable results
- **Full Body**: Retains more coffee oils and body than cone drippers
- **Even Extraction**: Flat bed extracts uniformly (no channeling in center)
- **Temperature Stable**: Air channels insulate, better heat retention
- **Aesthetically Pleasing**: Beautiful design, café favorite
- **Versatile**: Works for various coffee types and roast levels

**Kalita Wave vs. V60**:
- **Kalita**: Flat bottom, more forgiving, fuller body, more consistent
- **V60**: Conical, technique-sensitive, brighter, more clarity, higher ceiling for experts
- **Choose Kalita if**: Want consistency over maximum clarity
- **Choose V60 if**: Enjoy technique exploration, want brightest cup possible

**Kalita Wave vs. Chemex**:
- **Kalita**: Small batches (1-2 cups), fuller body, faster
- **Chemex**: Large batches (3-6 cups), cleanest cup, slower
- **Choose Kalita if**: Brewing 1-2 cups, want body
- **Choose Chemex if**: Brewing for multiple people, want ultra-clean cup

## ⚙️ Equipment & Setup

### Required Equipment

**Kalita Wave Dripper**:
- **Sizes**: 
  - **#155** (1-2 cups): Most popular, home use
  - **#185** (2-4 cups): Larger batches, less common
- **Materials**:
  - **Stainless Steel**: Durable, retains heat, professional
  - **Ceramic**: Beautiful, heat-stable, fragile
  - **Glass**: Visual brew process, aesthetic, delicate
  - **Choice**: Stainless steel most practical, ceramic prettiest

**Kalita Wave Filters** (Essential):
- **Unique to Kalita**: Must use Kalita Wave filters (not universal)
- **Wave Pattern**: 20 corrugated ridges create air channels
- **Material**: Paper (bleached or unbleached)
- **Cost**: ~$10-15 for 100 filters
- **Tip**: Buy in bulk, always have on hand

**Kettle** (Gooseneck Recommended):
- **Pourover-specific**: Gooseneck kettle for pour control
- **Temperature Control**: Variable temp ideal (Fellow Stagg EKG, Bonavita, etc.)
- **Manual Okay**: Regular kettle works but less precise

**Scale** (0.1g Precision Required):
- **Must-have**: Pour-over requires weighing coffee and water
- **Features**: Timer essential (built-in or separate)
- **Examples**: Hario V60 Drip Scale, Acaia Pearl/Lunar, Brewista Smart Scale

**Grinder** (Burr Essential):
- **Burr grinder**: Absolutely required (blade = inconsistent extraction)
- **Quality**: Better grinder = better results
- **Recommendation**: Baratza Encore minimum, Virtuoso+ or better ideal

**Optional**:
- **Carafe or Server**: Brew into carafe for easier serving
- **Thermometer**: If kettle lacks temp control

### Setup

1. **Boil Water**: Heat to 200-205°F (93-96°C)
2. **Weigh Coffee**: 20g for #155, 30g for #185
3. **Grind**: Medium grind (table salt consistency)
4. **Rinse Filter**: 
   - Place wave filter in dripper
   - Pour hot water through filter (200g+)
   - Warms dripper, removes paper taste
   - Discard rinse water
5. **Add Coffee**: Pour ground coffee into rinsed filter
6. **Flatten Bed**: Gently shake/tap to level grounds (flat bed critical)
7. **Place on Scale**: Dripper on cup/carafe, on scale, tare to zero

## 📝 Standard Recipe

### Basic Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coffee Dose** | 20g | For #155 (1-2 cups) |
| **Water** | 320g | Total water |
| **Ratio** | 1:16 | Balanced, adjust to taste |
| **Grind Size** | Medium | Table salt, slightly finer than V60 |
| **Water Temp** | 200-205°F (93-96°C) | Hotter = more extraction |
| **Total Time** | 2:45-3:30 | Target finish time |
| **Yield** | ~280-300ml | After coffee absorption |

### Step-by-Step Brewing

**Phase 1: Bloom (0:00-0:45)**
1. **Start Timer**: Begin when water first touches coffee
2. **Pour 40-50g water** (2-2.5x coffee weight):
   - Pour gently in spiral from center outward
   - Ensure all grounds saturated evenly
   - **Goal**: Release CO₂, pre-wet coffee, begin extraction
3. **Swirl Gently** (Optional):
   - Gentle circular swirl to ensure saturation
   - Helps even bloom
4. **Wait**: Let bloom for 30-45 seconds total
   - **Observation**: Grounds should bubble, expand, degas
   - **Good bloom**: Doming, active bubbling
   - **Poor bloom**: Flat, minimal bubbling (stale coffee)

**Phase 2: Main Pour (0:45-2:00)**

**Method 1: Continuous Pour** (Recommended for Beginners):
- **0:45**: Begin pouring in spiral pattern
- **Pour steadily**: Maintain water level ~50-75% up filter
- **Spiral**: Center → outer edge → center (continuous loop)
- **Avoid edges**: Don't pour directly on filter (bypass)
- **Goal**: Reach 320g total by 2:00
- **Observation**: Consistent flow rate, bed stays suspended in water

**Method 2: Pulse Pouring** (More Control):
- **0:45**: Pour to 120g (80g added) - **first pulse**
- **Let drain** to ~50% level
- **1:15**: Pour to 220g (100g added) - **second pulse**
- **Let drain** to ~50% level
- **1:45**: Pour to 320g (100g added) - **final pulse**
- **Observation**: Pulsing allows more control, can adjust each pour

**Key Kalita Wave Technique** (Both Methods):
- **Flat Bed Maintenance**: Keep bed level and flat
- **Avoid High-and-Dry**: Don't let grounds on filter dry out
- **Even Saturation**: All coffee stays submerged or evenly wet
- **Gentle Pouring**: No aggressive pours that disturb bed

**Phase 3: Draw-Down (2:00-3:30)**
- **2:00**: All water added (320g total)
- **Let drain**: Coffee bed slowly drains through three holes
- **2:30-3:30**: Target finish time (when dripping stops)
- **Observation**: 
  - **Even drawdown**: Flat bed, even descent
  - **Clean sides**: Grounds don't stick to filter excessively
  - **Final bed**: Flat, uniform, no high center or doming

**Phase 4: Serve**
- **Remove Dripper**: Once dripping stops
- **Swirl Cup**: Gentle swirl to homogenize
- **Enjoy**: Serve immediately while hot

## 🎯 Tips & Techniques

### For Better Results

**Coffee Preparation**:
- **Fresh Coffee**: 7-21 days off roast ideal
- **Grind Fresh**: Immediately before brewing
- **Uniform Grind**: Burr grinder, minimal fines
- **Weigh Precisely**: 0.1g accuracy for consistency

**Water Quality**:
- **Filtered**: Remove chlorine minimum
- **Mineral Content**: 80-150 ppm TDS ideal
- **Temperature**: 200-205°F for most coffees (adjust for roast)

**Technique Tips**:
- **Flat Bed**: Tap/shake to level before brewing - critical for Kalita
- **Slow Spiral**: Gentle, consistent pouring
- **Maintain Level**: Keep water level steady during pour
- **No Bypass**: Don't pour directly on filter sides
- **Patience**: Let each pulse drain before next pour (if pulse pouring)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- **Pouring too fast**: Agitates bed, creates uneven extraction
- **Pouring directly on filter**: Bypasses coffee (water flows down sides)
- **Disturbing flat bed**: Creates channels, uneven extraction
- **Wrong grind**: Too fine = over-extraction/slow; too coarse = under-extraction
- **Inconsistent pour rate**: Creates variable extraction
- **Not rinsing filter**: Paper taste in cup

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Sour, under-extracted** | Grind too coarse, water too cool, too fast | Grind finer, increase water temp, slow pour rate |
| **Bitter, over-extracted** | Grind too fine, water too hot, over-time | Grind coarser, lower temp, check draw-down time |
| **Draw-down too fast (<2:30)** | Grind too coarse, pour too fast | Grind finer, pour more slowly |
| **Draw-down too slow (>4:00)** | Grind too fine, clogged with fines | Grind coarser, check grinder quality |
| **Weak, watery** | Ratio too high, grind coarse | Use 1:15 ratio, grind finer |
| **Muddy, cloudy** | Fines in cup, broken filter | Better grinder, careful filter placement |
| **Astringent** | Over-extraction, water too hot | Lower temp, grind coarser, shorter time |
| **Flat, boring** | Stale coffee, under-extraction | Fresh coffee, grind finer, hotter water |
| **Channeling** (uneven bed) | Uneven pour, disturbed bed | Gentle spiral pour, flat bed before brewing |
