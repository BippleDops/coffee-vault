## 📋 Overview

The siphon (vacuum pot) is coffee brewing's most theatrical and scientifically fascinating method - using vapor pressure and vacuum to brew coffee through full immersion, then pulling brewed coffee back down through a filter via vacuum. Originally invented in 1830s Germany, perfected in Japan, the siphon delivers exceptionally clean, complex coffee while providing mesmerizing visual theater that captivates audiences and elevates coffee to performance art.

**What Makes Siphon Brewing Special**:
- **Theater**: Most visually dramatic brew method - fire, bubbling, vacuum magic
- **Science**: Demonstrates vapor pressure, vacuum, phase changes
- **Immersion**: Full immersion extraction (like French Press) ensures even extraction
- **Clarity**: Cloth or paper filter removes sediment (cleaner than French Press)
- **Temperature Control**: Maintains consistent high temperature throughout brew
- **Complexity**: Highlights nuanced flavors, layer after layer
- **Clean Cup**: Exceptional clarity, bright, articulate
- **Café Showpiece**: Customer engagement, visual appeal, conversation starter
- **Japanese Tradition**: Central to Japanese kissaten (traditional coffee houses)

**Historical Journey**:
- **1830s**: Loeff of Berlin patents early vacuum brewer
- **1840s**: Madame Vassieux (France) creates commercial version
- **Late 1800s**: Various European designs emerge
- **Early 1900s**: Popularity in Europe and America
- **1920s-1930s**: Silex and Cona brands dominate (glass laboratory equipment companies)
- **Post-WWII**: Declined in West (electric drip machines)
- **Japan**: Adopted, refined, perfected - became kissaten standard
- **1990s-2000s**: Third-wave specialty rediscovery
- **Present**: Specialty cafés, home enthusiasts, competition brewing

**Why Siphon (Almost) Disappeared**:
- Labor intensive
- Fragile glassware
- Open flame (safety concerns)
- Complex compared to drip machines
- **Saved by Japan**: Japanese coffee culture preserved and perfected it

## ⚙️ Equipment & How It Works

### Siphon Components

**Lower Chamber (Flask/Bulb)**:
- **Pyrex or borosilicate glass** (heat-resistant)
- **Capacity**: 2-8 cups (360ml-1.2L typical)
- **Function**: Holds water, heats, creates vapor pressure

**Upper Chamber (Hopper/Funnel)**:
- **Glass funnel** with tube extending into lower chamber
- **Function**: Holds coffee grounds, brewing happens here
- **Seal**: Rubber or silicone gasket creates seal with lower chamber

**Filter**:
- **Cloth Filter** (traditional): 
  - Flannel or cotton, reusable
  - Requires cleaning, storage in water
  - Fuller body, some oils pass through
  - Traditional, preferred by purists
- **Paper Filter**:
  - Disposable, convenient
  - Cleaner cup, removes more oils
  - Less maintenance
- **Metal Filter**: 
  - Reusable, easy to clean
  - Most oils pass (like French Press)

**Filter Chain/Rod**:
- Metal chain or rod secures filter in upper chamber
- Hooks to rim or glass rod in chamber

**Heat Source**:
- **Butane Burner** (recommended): Adjustable, safe, portable
- **Alcohol Burner**: Traditional, harder to control
- **Halogen Beam Heater**: Modern, precise, expensive (Hario brand)
- **Gas Stovetop**: Can work but difficult to control

**Stand/Frame**:
- Holds siphon securely
- Safety critical (hot glass, flames)

## 🔬 How the Siphon Works (The Science)

### Phase 1: Heating (Vapor Pressure Rises)

1. **Water in Lower Chamber**: Fill with water (e.g., 300g)
2. **Heat Applied**: Burner heats water
3. **Temperature Rises**: Water approaches boiling (212°F/100°C)
4. **Vapor Pressure Increases**: Steam forms, pressure builds in sealed lower chamber
5. **Water Rises**: 
   - Vapor pressure forces water up through tube into upper chamber
   - Water displaced by expanding steam/vapor
   - **Not boiling yet** (typically 195-205°F when rising)
6. **Immersion Begins**: Hot water meets coffee in upper chamber

**Physics**: Vapor pressure + closed system = water displacement upward

### Phase 2: Brewing (Full Immersion)

1. **Water in Upper Chamber**: Nearly all water rises (leaving ~50g in bottom)
2. **Coffee Added** (or already in upper chamber): Stir to saturate
3. **Full Immersion**: Coffee fully submerged in hot water
4. **Temperature**: Maintained ~195-205°F by continued heating
5. **Steep**: 30-90 seconds (varies by recipe)
6. **Agitation**: Stir 1-3 times to ensure even extraction

**Physics**: Continuous heating maintains temperature, gentle simmer

### Phase 3: Draw-Down (Vacuum Pulls Coffee Back)

1. **Remove Heat**: Turn off burner, remove heat source
2. **Cooling Begins**: Lower chamber cools
3. **Vapor Condenses**: Steam condenses back to liquid water
4. **Pressure Drops**: Vacuum forms in lower chamber
5. **Coffee Pulled Down**:
   - Vacuum sucks brewed coffee through filter
   - Grounds remain in upper chamber (trapped by filter)
   - Brewed coffee accumulates in lower chamber
6. **Complete**: All liquid in lower chamber, grounds in upper chamber

**Physics**: Cooling → vapor condensation → pressure drop → vacuum → liquid pulled down

**The Magic**: Watching coffee pulled down by vacuum is mesmerizing - coffee bubbles, filter dome forms, last drops pulled through. Pure coffee theater.

## 📝 Standard Recipe

**Parameters**:
- **Coffee**: 20-25g
- **Water**: 300-350g (1:15 to 1:14 ratio)
- **Grind**: Medium (table salt, slightly finer than pour-over)
- **Water Temp**: Brew temp maintained ~200-205°F
- **Steep Time**: 45-90 seconds in upper chamber
- **Total Time**: 5-7 minutes (including heat-up and draw-down)

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Setup** (2 min):
   - Insert filter in upper chamber, attach chain/rod
   - Add 320g water to lower chamber
   - Place lower chamber on heat source
   - **Don't attach upper chamber yet**

2. **Heat Water** (2-3 min):
   - Heat until water near boiling
   - Small bubbles forming
   - **Optimal**: ~200°F before assembly

3. **Assemble** (When water hot):
   - Insert upper chamber into lower chamber
   - **Seal**: Ensure gasket seals properly
   - **Water Rises**: Vapor pressure forces water up (15-45 seconds)
   - **Almost all water** should rise to upper chamber

4. **Add Coffee** (When water fully risen):
   - Pour 22g ground coffee into upper chamber water
   - **Stir Immediately**: Gentle stir to saturate all grounds
   - **Start Timer**: Begin 45-90 second steep

5. **Steep** (45-90 seconds):
   - **Maintain Heat**: Keep gentle simmer (not aggressive boil)
   - **Optional Stir**: Stir once at 30 seconds
   - **Observation**: Coffee fully immersed, extracting evenly
   - **Temperature**: Should maintain ~200-205°F

6. **Remove Heat** (At desired steep time):
   - **Turn off burner** and/or remove from heat
   - **Immediately**: Coffee begins drawing down
   - **Don't rush**: Let vacuum work (45-90 seconds draw-down)

7. **Draw-Down** (45-90 sec):
   - Watch coffee pulled through filter
   - **Dome Forms**: Filter domes up as last liquid pulled through
   - **Complete**: When dome collapses and hissing stops

8. **Serve**:
   - Remove upper chamber (careful - hot!)
   - Swirl lower chamber to homogenize
   - Pour and serve immediately

## 🎯 Tips & Techniques

**For Best Results**:
- **Dry Upper Chamber**: Ensure dry before assembly (water beads cause incomplete rise)
- **Good Seal**: Gasket must seal properly (water won't rise otherwise)
- **Gentle Heat**: Strong boil agitates too much, weakens flavor
- **Stir Well**: Initial stir critical for even saturation
- **Time Precisely**: 15-30 second variation = noticeable flavor difference
- **Remove Heat Completely**: Half-heat = slow draw-down, over-extraction

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Water won't rise**: Seal not tight, check gasket
- **Too much boiling**: Aggressive heat, bitter/harsh
- **Grind too fine**: Clogs filter, slow draw-down
- **Not stirring**: Dry clumps, uneven extraction
- **Over-steeping**: Forgot to remove heat, bitter
