## 📝 Traditional Recipe

**Sweetness Levels** (Traditional Turkish):
- **Sade** (Plain): No sugar
- **Az Şekerli** (Little Sugar): 1/2 tsp per cup
- **Orta Şekerli** (Medium Sugar): 1 tsp per cup
- **Şekerli/Tatlı** (Sweet): 2 tsp per cup

**Standard Recipe** (1 Cup):
- **Coffee**: 7-10g ultra-fine ground
- **Water**: 60-90ml (2-3 oz)
- **Sugar**: Per preference (added before brewing)
- **Ratio**: ~1:8 to 1:10 (very concentrated)

**Process**:

1. **Combine** (Cold Start):
   - Add water to ibrik
   - Add Turkish-ground coffee
   - Add sugar (if desired)
   - **Stir** to combine thoroughly (critical - no clumps)
   - **Cold start**: Begin with cold water (traditional)

2. **First Heat** (Low-Medium Heat):
   - Place ibrik on low-medium heat
   - **Watch constantly**: Never leave unattended
   - Coffee will begin dissolving, mixture darkening
   - **Slow heat**: Gentle is key (3-5 minutes total)

3. **First Foam** (Before Boiling):
   - Foam (kaymak) begins forming on surface
   - **Just before boil**: Foam expands
   - **Critical**: Remove from heat BEFORE actual boil
   - **Timing**: When foam rises to rim of ibrik

4. **Distribute Foam**:
   - **Spoon foam** into serving cup(s)
   - Foam distributed ensures each cup gets signature foam layer
   - Return ibrik to heat

5. **Second Heat** (Bring to Boil):
   - Return to heat
   - **Boil**: Allow to rise once (foam/liquid rises dramatically)
   - **Remove immediately**: Don't let boil over!
   - Some traditions: Repeat 2-3 times (rise, remove, return)

6. **Serve**:
   - **Pour into cups**: Grounds and all (unfiltered)
   - **Foam on top**: Each cup should have foam layer
   - **Serve immediately**: With glass of water, Turkish delight (traditional accompaniments)

7. **Wait** (Critical):
   - **Let grounds settle**: 1-2 minutes before drinking
   - Grounds sink to bottom of cup
   - **Drink top 2/3**: Leave bottom 1/3 (grounds remain)

## 🎯 Tips & Technique

**For Best Results**:
- **Stir initially**: No clumps (ruins foam formation)
- **Low heat**: Slow heating develops flavor, foam
- **Watch constantly**: Boils over in seconds if unattended
- **Don't actually boil**: Remove just as foam rises (before full boil)
- **Cold water**: Start cold (traditional), develops better
- **Quality coffee**: Fresh, quality coffee matters (ultra-fine shows defects)

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Boiling over**: Messy, burnt, bitter (watch carefully!)
- **No foam**: Heated too fast or stirred after heating started
- **Clumpy**: Not stirred initially, uneven extraction
- **Bitter**: Actually boiled (remove before boil)
- **Weak**: Not enough coffee or too coarse grind
