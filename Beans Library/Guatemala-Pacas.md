**Variety**: Pacas (Bourbon Mutation from El Salvador)  
**Processing**: Washed  
**Altitude**: 1,300-1,800 MASL

## 📋 Overview

Guatemala Pacas is a compact Bourbon mutation (originally from El Salvador) that thrives in Guatemalan volcanic highlands, producing balanced, sweet, chocolate-citrus coffees with excellent cup quality and better productivity than standard Bourbon. As parent to the famous Pacamara variety, Pacas represents the bridge between traditional quality and modern productivity.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Bourbon Quality**: Maintains Bourbon sweetness and complexity
- **Compact**: Smaller than Bourbon (easier harvesting, higher density planting)
- **Better Yield**: 30-40% more productive than Bourbon
- **Guatemala Expression**: Volcanic terroir creates chocolate-citrus-spice profile
- **Pacamara Parent**: One half of Pacamara genetics (Pacas × Maragogipe)
- **Reliable**: Consistent quality, forgiving to brew
- **Value**: Excellent quality-to-price ratio for Guatemalan coffee

**Discovery & History**:
- **1949**: Discovered in El Salvador (Pacas family farm, hence name)
- **Bourbon Mutation**: Natural dwarf mutation of Bourbon variety
- **1950s-1960s**: Spread to Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
- **Adoption**: Widely planted for improved productivity
- **Pacamara Creation** (1958): Crossed with Maragogipe → Pacamara
- **Present**: 10-15% of Guatemalan coffee, valued for quality-productivity balance
