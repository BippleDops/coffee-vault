# 🫘 Brazil Icatu

**Origin**: Brazil  
**Variety**: Icatu (Complex Interspecific Hybrid)  
**Developed**: IAC (Instituto Agronômico de Campinas), Brazil  
**Purpose**: Rust Resistance + Productivity + Quality

---

## 📋 Overview

Brazil Icatu is sophisticated coffee breeding - a complex interspecific hybrid combining Arabica quality with Robusta disease resistance through generations of backcrossing, creating productive, rust-resistant coffee that maintains specialty-grade cup quality. Icatu represents Brazilian coffee research success and modern variety development done right.

**What is Icatu**:
- **Complex Hybrid**: Arabica × Robusta (backcrossed to remove Robusta traits)
- **IAC Development**: Brazilian research institute breeding program (1970s-1990s)
- **Rust Resistant**: Strong disease resistance from Robusta genetics
- **Good Quality**: Maintained Arabica cup quality through selection
- **Productive**: High yield (40-60% more than Bourbon)
- **Large Beans**: Similar size to Mundo Novo
- **Specialty Grade**: Achieves 82-86+ cup scores

**Genetic Background**:
- **Parents**: Bourbon × Robusta (initial cross)
- **Backcrossing**: Multiple generations bred back to Arabica
- **Result**: 25-50% Robusta genetics (varies by Icatu line)
- **Goal**: Rust resistance without Robusta flavor
- **Success**: Achieved both goals reasonably well

**Development Timeline**:
- **1970s-1980s**: IAC begins interspecific breeding
- **1990s**: Icatu released to farmers
- **2000s**: Adoption increases, rust pressure drives interest
- **Present**: 5-15% of Brazilian coffee, growing
