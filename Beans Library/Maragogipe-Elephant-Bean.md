# 🫘 Maragogipe - The Original Elephant Bean

**Origin**: Brazil (Discovered in Maragogipe, Bahia)  
**Variety**: Maragogipe (Typica Natural Mutation)  
**Size**: Largest Coffee Beans (Screen 19-22+)  
**Nickname**: "Elephant Bean"

---

## 📋 Overview

Maragogipe is coffee's giant - a natural Typica mutation discovered in Brazil producing beans 30-100% larger than standard coffee, with unique mild, sweet, low-acid flavor profiles. While agricultural challenges (very low yield) limit commercial production, Maragogipe's distinctive size and flavor make it specialty curiosity and parent to important hybrids (Pacamara, Maracaturra).

**What Makes Maragogipe Unique**:
- **Largest Beans**: Biggest coffee beans in existence (screen 19-22+)
- **Typica Mutation**: Natural mutation, not hybrid
- **Low Yield**: Extremely low productivity (20-30% of normal varieties)
- **Unique Flavor**: Mild, sweet, low-acid, gentle, distinctive
- **Parent Variety**: Used to create Pacamara, Maracaturra (elephant bean hybrids)
- **Visual Impact**: Dramatically large, impressive appearance
- **Rare**: Commercial production minimal (economics unfavorable)
- **Specialty Novelty**: Curiosity item, limited availability

**Discovery**:
- **1870s**: Discovered in Maragogipe, Bahia, Brazil
- **Mutation**: Natural Typica mutation (spontaneous)
- **Recognition**: Immediately recognized for giant bean size
- **Spread**: Distributed to other origins (Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua)
- **Peak**: Early-mid 1900s, some commercial production
- **Decline**: Replaced by higher-yielding varieties
- **Present**: Specialty micro-lots only, very limited
