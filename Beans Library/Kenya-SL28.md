## 🔄 Kenyan Processing: Double Fermentation

### Why Kenyan Processing is Unique

Kenya's washed processing is more intensive than anywhere else:

**Standard Washed** (Other Countries):
- Depulp → Ferment 12-24 hours → Wash → Dry

**Kenyan Double Fermentation**:
- Depulp → Ferment #1 (12-24 hrs) → Wash → Ferment #2 (12-24 hrs) → Final wash → Soak → Dry

**The Process** (Step-by-Step):

1. **Harvest** (Selective Hand-Picking):
   - Only ripe red cherries
   - Multiple passes during season
   - Delivered to washing station (factory) same day

2. **Reception & Sorting**:
   - Floatation tanks remove unripe/defective cherries
   - Grading by ripeness and size

3. **Depulping**:
   - Mechanical removal of skin and some fruit
   - Disc pulpers typical
   - Mucilage remains on parchment

4. **First Fermentation** (Dry Fermentation):
   - **12-24 hours** in fermentation tanks (no water added)
   - Natural enzymes break down outer mucilage layer
   - Altitude/temperature determines duration
   - Cooler highlands = longer fermentation
   - Monitored by touch/visual inspection

5. **First Washing**:
   - Beans washed in channels with fresh water
   - Removes loosened mucilage
   - Density sorting (floaters removed)

6. **Second Fermentation** (Dry or Wet):
   - **12-24 additional hours**
   - Removes remaining mucilage
   - Further flavor development
   - Critical for Kenyan brightness

7. **Final Washing**:
   - Thorough washing in clean water channels
   - Multiple rinses
   - Complete mucilage removal
   - Density sorting again

8. **Soaking** (Optional but Common):
   - 12-24 hour soak in clean water
   - Clarifies final cup, enhances brightness
   - Softens parchment for easier drying

9. **Drying**:
   - **Raised African drying beds** (standard in Kenya)
     - Mesh screens for airflow
     - 10-21 days depending on weather
     - Covered at night and during rain
     - Raked regularly for even drying
   - **Target moisture**: 10-12%
   - **Color**: Pale green-blue parchment when properly dried

10. **Dry Milling**:
    - Hulling (parchment removed)
    - Grading by size (AA, AB, etc.)
    - Density sorting (catador machine)
    - Hand sorting for defects
    - Preparation for auction or direct sale

**Impact on Flavor**:
- **Extreme Clarity**: Double fermentation creates exceptional cleanliness
- **Bright Acidity**: Processing enhances natural acidity dramatically
- **Complexity**: Extended fermentation develops flavor precursors
- **Clean Cup**: No defects, no off-flavors
- **Consistency**: Rigorous process ensures batch-to-batch uniformity

## 🔥 Roasting Kenya SL-28

### Optimal Roast Levels

**Light Roast (City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Highlights**: Blackcurrant, berry, complexity, bright acidity
- **Best for**: Pour-over, showcasing SL-28 character
- **Result**: Explosive fruit, vibrant, clean, complex
- **Target**: Drop 30-60 seconds into first crack
- **Color**: Light brown, no oil

**Light-Medium (City+)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **ALSO EXCELLENT**
- **Balance**: Fruit + developing sweetness
- **Acidity**: Still very high but slightly mellowed
- **Body**: Fuller than pure light
- **Versatile**: Works for pour-over and espresso
- **Target**: Drop 60-90 seconds into first crack

**Medium (Full City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Trade-off**: Sweetness increases, acidity decreases
- **Berry**: Still present but less intense
- **Body**: Full, syrupy
- **Use**: Espresso, those seeking less acidity
- **Result**: Still good, but some SL-28 magic lost

**Medium-Dark (Vienna)** ⭐⭐
- **Not Recommended**: Origin character significantly diminished
- Roast flavors begin dominating
- Blackcurrant mostly gone
- Use only if requested or blending

**Dark Roast** ⭐ **Never**
- Complete waste of SL-28
- All unique characteristics destroyed
- Might as well use commodity coffee

### Roasting Technique

**SL-28 Roasting Characteristics**:
- **Density**: Very high (slow growth at altitude)
- **Heat Absorption**: Requires good heat application
- **Drying Phase**: Longer than average (dense beans)
- **Development**: Short development preserves brightness
- **Challenge**: Balancing development with preserving acidity

**Recommended Profile**:
1. **Charge**: 390-410°F (199-210°C)
2. **Drying**: 5-6 minutes to yellow (dense beans need time)
3. **Browning**: 4-5 minutes to first crack
4. **First Crack**: 10-12 minutes total
5. **Development**: **30-90 seconds** (shorter = brighter)
6. **Drop Temp**: 
   - Light: 405-410°F (207-210°C)
   - Light-Medium: 410-418°F (210-214°C)
   - Medium: 418-425°F (214-218°C)

**Tips**:
- **Don't rush**: Dense beans need time to develop evenly
- **Watch for tipping**: High heat can scorch dense beans
- **Preserve acids**: Short development time critical
- **Cool quickly**: Rapid cooling locks in brightness
- **Rest**: 3-10 days rest optimal for SL-28

**Extraction**:
- **Higher extraction** works well (Kenya is forgiving)
- Don't under-extract (sour, thin)
- Aim for 20-22% extraction yield
- **TDS Target**: 1.30-1.50% for filter coffee

**Temperature**:
- **Hot water** essential (200-205°F)
- Kenyan acidity needs heat to balance with sweetness
- Too cool = sour and unbalanced

**Tasting**:
- **Taste as it cools**: SL-28 transforms from hot to warm to cool
- Best flavors often at 150-170°F (65-77°C)
- Still delicious at room temperature
