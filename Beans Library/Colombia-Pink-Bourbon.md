- **Altitude**: 1,600-2,100 MASL
- **Epicenter**: Where Pink Bourbon first gained recognition
- **Soil**: Rich volcanic, mineral-dense
- **Climate**: Cool, high altitude, ideal for Pink Bourbon
- **Character**: Fruit-forward, berry, complex acidity
- **Recognition**: Most famous Pink Bourbon comes from Huila
- **Notable Farms**: Multiple award-winning micro-lots

**Cauca (Southwestern Colombia)**:
- **Altitude**: 1,700-2,000 MASL
- **Terrain**: Mountainous, volcanic
- **Climate**: Cool, misty, high-altitude ideal
- **Character**: Tropical fruit, floral, wine-like

- Possibly Ethiopian heirloom landrace
- OR unique spontaneous mutation in Colombia
- Genetic research ongoing

**What's Debated**:
- **Is it Bourbon?**: Likely not, despite name
- **Ethiopian origin?**: Some evidence suggests Ethiopian genetics
- **Spontaneous mutation?**: Could be unique Colombian development
- **Unique variety?**: May be distinct variety, not Bourbon variant
- **Naming**: "Pink Bourbon" may be misnomer, but name stuck

## 🔥 Roasting Pink Bourbon

### Optimal Roast Levels

**Light Roast (City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **IDEAL**
- **Best expression**: Showcases fruit, floral, complexity
- Preserves delicate berry and tropical notes
- Bright acidity fully expressed
- Light body, tea-like
- Maximum complexity
- Preferred by specialty roasters
- Pour-over ideal brewing

**Light-Medium (City+)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **VERSATILE**
- **Excellent balance**: Fruit + developing sweetness
- Berry still dominant
- Acidity mellows slightly
- Body increases
- Caramel emerges
- Versatile for multiple brew methods
- Broader appeal than pure light

**Medium (Full City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Trade-off**: Sweetness vs. fruit intensity
- Caramel and chocolate develop
- Berry diminishes (still present)
- Acidity balanced
- Fuller body
- Good for those finding light too bright
- **Risk**: Loses some Pink Bourbon magic

**Medium-Dark (Vienna)** ⭐⭐
- **Not recommended**: Origin character fades
- Fruit notes mostly gone
- Chocolate and roast flavors dominate
- **Waste of Pink Bourbon**: Better varieties for this roast

**Dark Roast (French)** ⭐ **Never**
- Absolute waste
- All Pink Bourbon character destroyed
- Might as well use commodity coffee
- Don't do this

**Verdict**: Light to light-medium roasts essential. Medium acceptable. Anything darker wastes Pink Bourbon's unique character.

### Roasting Technique

**Pink Bourbon Roasting Characteristics**:
- **Density**: High (high-altitude growth)
- **Delicate Compounds**: Fruit and floral compounds volatile
- **Narrow Window**: Easy to over-develop and lose magic
- **Challenge**: Balance development with preserving fruit

**Recommended Light Roast Profile**:
1. **Charge**: 385-400°F (196-204°C)
2. **Drying**: 5-6 minutes to yellow
3. **Browning**: 3-4 minutes to first crack
4. **First Crack**: 9-11 minutes total
5. **Development**: **45-75 seconds post-crack** (short!)
   - Longer = more caramel, less fruit
   - Shorter = more fruit, brighter
6. **Drop Temp**: 402-410°F (206-210°C)
   - City to City+ roast level
   - Light to light-medium brown

**Critical Tips**:
- **Don't over-develop**: Pink Bourbon's magic is delicate
- **Short development**: 45-75 seconds post-crack maximum
- **Cool rapidly**: Preserve fruit compounds
- **Rest 3-7 days**: Needs rest but degasses faster than darker roasts
- **Sample first**: Learn coffee before committing
- **Err light**: Under-development better than over for Pink Bourbon
