## 📋 Overview

Java coffee represents Indonesian coffee's colonial heritage - from large estates established by Dutch in 1600s-1700s producing the original "Java" that became synonymous with coffee itself ("Cup of Joe"), to modern specialty estates reviving washed processing and quality focus. Java combines Indonesian earthy character with estate coffee refinement, producing full-bodied, low-acid, chocolate-spice coffees with rustic charm.

**Historical Significance**:
- **First Outside Arabia/Ethiopia**: Coffee cultivation outside origin regions began in Java (1696)
- **Dutch East India Company**: Established coffee plantations in Java (1700s)
- **"Java" = Coffee**: The word "Java" became slang for coffee (English language)
- **"Cup of Joe"**: Possibly derived from "Cup of Java"
- **Mocha-Java Blend**: Original coffee blend (Yemen Mocha + Java), 1700s-1800s, still famous
- **Colonial Legacy**: Large estates from Dutch era still operate (Jampit, Blawan, Kayumas)
- **Leaf Rust Epidemic** (1876-1900): Destroyed Java's Arabica, replanted with Robusta
- **Arabica Return** (1920s-present): Estates slowly reintroduced Arabica
- **Today**: Mix of heritage estates and smallholder production

**Java vs. Sumatra**:
- **Java**: More estate-focused, some washed processing, slightly higher altitude
- **Sumatra**: Smallholder-dominated, almost all wet-hulled, lower altitude
- **Both**: Indonesian character - earthy, full-bodied, low-acid
- **Java Advantage**: Estate quality control, occasional fully washed lots
- **Sumatra Volume**: Much larger production
