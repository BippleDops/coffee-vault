## 🌍 Origin & Geography

### Primary Growing Regions

**Sul de Minas (Southern Minas Gerais)**:
- Largest specialty coffee producing region in Brazil
- **Altitude**: 900-1,300 MASL (perfect for Yellow Bourbon)
- **Climate**: Moderate temperatures, distinct wet/dry seasons
- **Soil**: Rich, volcanic-influenced soil
- **Flavor**: Classic Yellow Bourbon profile - chocolate, nuts, caramel
- **Production**: Both natural and pulped natural processing

**Cerrado Mineiro**:
- First Brazilian region with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)
- **Altitude**: 800-1,300 MASL
- **Climate**: Consistent, predictable seasons (mechanization-friendly)
- **Soil**: Red-yellow latosol, rich in iron and minerals
- **Flavor**: Clean, sweet, balanced - ideal for blending
- **Production**: Mostly natural and pulped natural
- **Characteristic**: Uniform ripening due to flat terrain and climate

**Mogiana (São Paulo/Minas Gerais border)**:
- Historic coffee region, rolling hills
- **Altitude**: 900-1,400 MASL
- **Climate**: Subtropical, cooler temperatures
- **Soil**: Terra roxa (purple earth), volcanic origin, very fertile
- **Flavor**: Complex, with higher acidity than other Brazilian regions
- **Production**: Premium specialty focus
- **Heritage**: Some of Brazil's oldest coffee farms

**Other Regions**:
- **Alta Mogiana**: High-altitude portion of Mogiana
- **Mantiqueira de Minas**: Mountain region, higher altitude
- **Bahia**: Experimental Yellow Bourbon plantings
- **Espírito Santo**: Some production, lower altitude

### Climate & Terroir

**Growing Conditions**:
- **Temperature**: 18-22°C (64-72°F) average during growing season
- **Altitude**: 900-1,300 MASL (lower than African highlands, compensated by latitude)
- **Rainfall**: 1,200-1,600mm annually
- **Dry Season**: May-September (crucial for natural processing)
- **Harvest**: May-September (dry season harvest)
- **Frost Risk**: Occasional risk in southern regions (devastating when occurs)

**Soil Characteristics**:
- Terra roxa (purple earth): Decomposed volcanic basalt, extremely fertile
- Red-yellow latosol: High mineral content, good drainage

- Natural fertility reduces fertilizer need

**Why Brazil Produces Different Flavors**:
- Lower altitude than East Africa (compensated by latitude ~21°S)
- Warmer average temperatures
- Less extreme diurnal temperature variation
- Results in lower acidity, higher sweetness, fuller body
- Yellow Bourbon amplifies these characteristics

## 🌱 The Yellow Bourbon Variety

### Genetics & Characteristics

**Botanical Background**:
- **Species**: Coffea arabica
- **Lineage**: Bourbon variety → Yellow mutation
- **Mutation**: Recessive gene for yellow cherry color
- **Scientific**: Lacks genes for red/purple anthocyanin production
- **Discovery**: Natural mutation observed in Brazil early 1900s
- **Stability**: Breeds true (yellow parent → yellow offspring)

**Plant Characteristics**:
- **Size**: Medium height, similar to red Bourbon
- **Leaves**: Bronze-tipped young leaves (characteristic of Bourbon)
- **Cherries**: Yellow when ripe (golden-yellow, not green-yellow)
- **Yield**: Moderate to good (better than Typica, less than Catuai)
- **Disease**: Susceptible to coffee leaf rust (like all Bourbon types)
- **Longevity**: Long-lived, productive for 20+ years with care

**Cherry & Bean Appearance**:
- **Ripe Cherry**: Bright yellow to golden-yellow color
- **Harvest Challenge**: Yellow on tree requires experience to identify ripeness
- **Green Bean**: Slightly bluish-green, similar to other Bourbons
- **Roasted**: Can develop lighter roast color than other varieties
- **Size**: Medium to large beans, generally uniform

**Cultivation Challenges**:
- **Ripeness Detection**: Yellow cherries harder to identify than red when ripe
  - Solution: Experienced pickers, refractometer testing
- **Leaf Rust Susceptibility**: Requires fungicide program or organic management
- **Lower Yield**: Compared to modern hybrids like Catimor
- **Premium Only**: Only economical when fetching specialty prices
- **Plant Density**: Requires spacing similar to other Bourbons

## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Natural (Dry) Processing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Brazil's Specialty**:
Brazil pioneered modern natural processing at scale, and Yellow Bourbon shines in this method.

**Process**:
1. **Harvest**: Selective picking of ripe yellow cherries
2. **Sorting**: Floatation tank removes defects
3. **Drying**: Whole cherries spread on patios or raised beds
   - **Patios** (traditional): Concrete or brick patios, raked frequently
   - **Raised African beds** (specialty): Better airflow, slower drying, premium quality
   - **Mechanical pre-drying** (some farms): Guardiolas for initial drying
4. **Duration**: 15-30 days depending on weather and method
5. **Target**: 11-12% moisture content
6. **Storage**: In parchment until milling
7. **Milling**: Dry mill removes all dried cherry layers

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Sweetness**: Extreme - fruit sugars penetrate bean during drying
- **Body**: Full, syrupy, creamy mouthfeel
- **Chocolate**: Dark chocolate, cocoa, sometimes chocolate fudge
- **Fruit**: Dried fruit notes (raisin, date, fig)
- **Complexity**: Deep, layered, rich
- **Acidity**: Very low, smooth
- **Finish**: Long, sweet, lingering

### Pulped Natural (Semi-Washed) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Brazil's Innovation**:
Pulped natural (honey process) was developed in Brazil, and Yellow Bourbon excels here.

**Process**:
1. **Harvest**: Ripe yellow cherries
2. **Pulping**: Skin removed, mucilage left on bean
3. **Drying**: Sticky beans dried with mucilage intact
   - Similar drying methods as natural (patios, beds)
   - 10-20 days drying time
   - Raked to prevent mold
4. **Milling**: Dried mucilage removed in dry mill

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Balance**: Between washed and natural
- **Sweetness**: High, but cleaner than full natural
- **Clarity**: Better than natural, more body than washed
- **Chocolate**: Milk chocolate, caramel
- **Fruit**: Subtle, clean fruit notes
- **Acidity**: Low-medium, balanced
- **Versatility**: Excellent for blending

### Washed Processing (Rare for Yellow Bourbon) ⭐⭐⭐

**Less Common**:
Yellow Bourbon's strength is sweetness, which washed processing diminishes. Rarely used.

**When Used**:
- Wet season harvests (emergency processing)
- Experimental lots
- Specific buyer requests
- Highlighting terroir over variety character

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Clarity**: High, very clean
- **Acidity**: Higher than natural/pulped natural (but still low for coffee generally)
- **Body**: Lighter, less creamy
- **Sweetness**: Present but muted
- **Result**: Loses Yellow Bourbon's signature character

**Verdict**: Stick with natural or pulped natural for Yellow Bourbon.
