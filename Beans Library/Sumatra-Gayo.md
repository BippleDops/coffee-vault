## 🌱 Varieties in Gayo Coffee

### Traditional Varieties

**Typica** (30-40% of production):
- Original variety brought by Dutch
- Tall trees, low yield
- Excellent cup quality
- **Flavor**: Clean, complex, less earthy than typical Gayo
- Declining due to low productivity

**Bourbon** (10-20%):

### Hybrid Varieties (Dominant in Modern Plantations)

**Catimor** (40-50%):
- Timor Hybrid x Caturra
- Introduced for rust resistance and yield
- **Yield**: 2-3x higher than Typica
- **Quality**: Lower cup quality than Typica/Bourbon
- **Flavor**: Earthy, woody, less complexity
- **Status**: Increasingly dominant (economic necessity)

**Tim Tim (Timor Timor)** (10-20%):
- Timor Hybrid selection
- Similar to Catimor
- Rust-resistant, high-yield
- **Quality**: Commodity-level, lower than Catimor

**Ateng/Lini S** (Various hybrids):
- Indonesian hybrid selections
- Mix of resistance and productivity
- Varying quality levels

## 🔄 Wet-Hulling (Giling Basah) Processing

### Indonesia's Unique Method

Wet-hulling is **nowhere else in coffee world** - unique to Indonesia (especially Sumatra).

**Why Wet-Hulling Exists**:
1. **High Humidity**: Traditional drying impossible (mold, fermentation)
2. **Economic**: Farmers need cash flow quickly
3. **Infrastructure**: Limited access to drying facilities
4. **Climate**: No dry season for extended patio drying
5. **Tradition**: Method developed over 100+ years

**Standard Washed (Most Countries)**:
- Depulp → Ferment → Wash → Dry in parchment → Hull

**Wet-Hulling (Giling Basah)**:
- Depulp → Brief fermentation → Wash → **Partially dry** → **Hull wet parchment** → Final drying

### Wet-Hulling Step-by-Step

1. **Harvest**:
   - Selective picking of ripe cherries
   - Brought to farm or small collection point

2. **Pulping** (Same day):
   - Hand-crank or small motorized pulpers
   - Skin and most fruit removed
   - Mucilage remains on parchment

3. **Fermentation** (12-24 hours):
   - Short fermentation in tanks or bags
   - Breaks down some mucilage
   - Less controlled than Kenya or Colombia

4. **Washing**:
   - Mucilage washed off
   - Clean parchment coffee emerges

5. **Partial Drying** (1-2 days):
   - **Critical difference**: Dried only to 30-50% moisture
   - Parchment still wet, flexible, soft
   - Typical drying targets 10-12% before hulling - NOT in Sumatra
   - Stops here to sell to collector

6. **Wet Hulling** (The Key Step):
   - **Parchment removed while beans still wet**
   - Hulling machine scrapes off wet parchment
   - Naked green bean exposed (no protective parchment)
   - **Moisture**: Beans at 30-50% moisture (vs. normal 10-12%)
   - Beans are soft, vulnerable

7. **Final Drying** (3-7 days):
   - Naked beans dried on patios or tarps
   - Exposed to sun, air, environment
   - **Target**: 12-13% moisture (slightly higher than usual)
   - Irregular drying creates visual defects

8. **Result**:
   - **Appearance**: Blue-green color, often irregular, broken beans
   - **Flavor**: Earthy, herbal, full-bodied, low-acid profile
   - **Body**: Very full, almost syrupy
   - **Clean cup**: Lower than washed coffees (not a defect, just different)

### Why Wet-Hulling Creates "Sumatra Flavor"

**Flavor Impact**:

1. **Earthy/Herbal Notes**:
   - Naked beans absorb environmental flavors during final drying
   - Soil, air, local microorganisms influence flavor
   - Forest floor, mushroom, cedar, tobacco notes develop

2. **Full Body**:
   - Cellular structure changes during wet hulling
   - Beans more porous, absorb water differently during brewing
   - Extracts more soluble solids → heavier body

3. **Low Acidity**:
   - Acids degrade during wet hulling exposure
   - Longer contact with moisture reduces brightness
   - Results in smooth, mellow cup

4. **Unique Character**:
   - No other coffee tastes like wet-hulled Sumatra
   - Instantly recognizable to experienced cuppers
   - Divisive: loved or hated, rarely neutral

**Appearance Defects** (Not Flavor Defects):
- Beans often split, cracked, irregular
- Blue-green color (from hulling stress)
- Mixed sizes
- Visual defects don't correlate with cup quality in Gayo

## 🔥 Roasting Gayo Coffee

### Optimal Roast Levels

**Light Roast** ⭐⭐ **Not Recommended**
- Earthy notes can be grassy, vegetal
- Herbal can taste raw, green
- Loses Sumatra's strengths
- Accentuates visual defects
- Better varieties exist for light roasting

**Medium Roast (Full City)** ⭐⭐⭐
- **Acceptable**: Earthiness becomes pleasant
- Chocolate notes emerge
- Body develops
- Still relatively low acidity
- Good for those exploring Sumatra

**Medium-Dark (Vienna)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Sweet spot** for Gayo
- Earthy balanced with chocolate
- Full body, smooth
- Caramelization sweetness
- Herbal becomes pleasant spice
- Classic Sumatra profile

**Dark Roast (French, Italian)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **TRADITIONAL**
- **Traditional Indonesian roast**
- Oily, dark brown to black
- Chocolate, smoke, char
- Very full body
- Zero acidity
- Excellent for French Press, espresso
- Some consider ideal expression of Sumatra

**Verdict**: Medium-dark to dark roasts are where Gayo shines. Don't light roast Sumatra.

### Roasting Technique

**Gayo Roasting Characteristics**:
- **Density**: Lower than high-altitude coffees
- **Moisture**: Often higher than other origins (13% vs. 10-12%)
- **Irregularity**: Mixed bean sizes and moisture
- **Heat Absorption**: Absorbs heat quickly
- **Forgiving**: Hard to ruin Sumatra (going dark is safe)

**Recommended Profile** (Medium-Dark):
1. **Charge**: 375-395°F (190-202°C)
2. **Drying**: 4-5 minutes (faster than dense coffees)
3. **Browning**: 3-4 minutes to first crack
4. **First Crack**: 8-10 minutes total
5. **Development**: **120-180 seconds** (longer for Sumatra)
6. **Drop Temp**: 425-440°F (218-227°C) for Vienna/French

**Tips**:
- **Embrace development**: Sumatra benefits from longer development
- **Don't rush**: Even though less dense, benefits from time
- **Darker is safer**: Won't highlight defects like light roasts
- **Smell for herbals turning pleasant**: When herbs become spice, you're there
- **Expect 2nd crack**: OK to go into second crack for Sumatra
