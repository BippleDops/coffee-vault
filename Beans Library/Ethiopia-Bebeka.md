# 🫘 Ethiopia Bebeka

**Origin**: Ethiopia (Bebeka, Southwest)  
**Variety**: Ethiopian Heirloom  
**Processing**: Natural, Washed  
**Altitude**: 1,000-1,700 MASL  
**Character**: Wine-Like, Full-Bodied, Rustic Ethiopian

## 📋 Overview

Ethiopia Bebeka is southwestern Ethiopia's rustic specialty - producing wine-like, full-bodied, chocolate-spice coffees with earthy undertones that make it Ethiopia's boldest and least delicate option. Bebeka represents Ethiopian coffee's full-spectrum diversity: from Yirgacheffe's tea-like delicacy to Bebeka's bold earthiness.

**Characteristics**:
- **Southwest Ethiopia**: Different terroir from famous eastern regions
- **Lower Altitude**: 1,000-1,700 MASL (lower than Yirgacheffe/Sidamo)
- **Forest Coffee**: Some wild/semi-wild forest coffee
- **Bold**: Full-bodied, rustic, earthy, wine-like
- **Natural Processing**: Predominantly natural (dry) processed
- **Commercial**: Larger production, less boutique than micro-regions
- **Underrated**: Less famous, good value
- **Different**: Not typical Ethiopian profile (no floral-tea delicacy)
