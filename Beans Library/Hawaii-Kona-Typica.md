## 📋 Overview

Hawaii Kona is American-grown coffee commanding luxury prices ($40-80/lb roasted) for mild, balanced, smooth coffees from volcanic slopes of Hawaii's Big Island. While quality is good and terroir unique, most specialty experts consider Kona significantly overpriced, with prices reflecting American origin, tourism, and labor costs rather than exceptional cup quality.

**Characteristics**:

- **Mild**: Very gentle, smooth, low-acid, balanced
- **Tourist Appeal**: Hawaii tourism drives demand and pricing
- **Labor Costs**: US labor = 10-20x higher than developing nations
- **Small Production**: Limited area, limited volume
- **Volcanic Terroir**: Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcano slopes
- **Low Altitude**: 150-900 MASL (very low compared to specialty origins)

**The Price Question**:
- **Green**: $20-40/lb (vs. $4-12 for comparable quality elsewhere)
- **Roasted**: $40-80/lb ($30-60/12oz)
- **Why?**: American labor, land costs, tourism premium, scarcity, not intrinsic quality
- **Worth It?**: Personal decision - supporting American farmers vs. value
