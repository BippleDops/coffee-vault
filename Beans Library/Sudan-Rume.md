# 🫘 Sudan Rume

**Origin**: Sudan/Ethiopia Border (Wild Type)  
**Variety**: Sudan Rume (Wild Coffee Species)  
**Current Cultivation**: Colombia, Central America (experimental)  
**Status**: Ultra-Rare, Experimental, Disease-Resistant Wild Type

---

## 📋 Overview

Sudan Rume is coffee's wild genetic resource - a wild-type coffee from Sudan-Ethiopia border region offering exceptional disease resistance AND remarkable cup quality, making it invaluable for breeding programs and ultra-premium experimental micro-lots. While commercially rare, Sudan Rume represents coffee's future: combining wild genetics with specialty quality.

**Why Sudan Rume Matters**:
- **Wild Type**: Natural wild coffee (not cultivated variety)
- **Disease Resistant**: Natural resistance to multiple coffee diseases
- **Quality + Resistance**: Rare combination (most resistant varieties sacrifice quality)
- **Genetic Resource**: Critical for coffee breeding programs globally
- **Complex Flavors**: Fruit-forward, floral, complex when grown well
- **Experimental**: Progressive farms trialing Sudan Rume
- **Low Yield**: Very low productivity (only viable with ultra-premium pricing)
- **Future**: Potential savior variety for climate-challenged regions

**Discovery & History**:
- **1940s**: Collected from Sudan-Ethiopia border region
- **Germplasm**: Preserved in research collections
- **Research**: Studied for disease resistance genetics
- **2000s-2010s**: Progressive farmers begin cultivating
- **Colombia**: Experimental plantings in high-altitude zones
- **Present**: Tiny commercial production, ultra-specialty micro-lots

## 🌱 Characteristics

**Plant Traits**:
- **Wild Type**: Undomesticated genetics
- **Disease Resistant**: Multiple disease resistance (natural)
- **Low Yield**: Extremely low productivity (20-30% of Caturra)
- **Challenging**: Difficult to cultivate commercially
- **Quality**: Excellent when grown at altitude

**Why Rarely Grown**:
- Very low yield (uneconomical)
- Better suited for breeding than production
- Only ultra-premium prices justify cultivation

**Why Important**:
- **Breeding**: Genetic resource for developing resistant varieties
- **Climate**: Potential for warming coffee zones
- **Diversity**: Preserving wild coffee genetics
- **Quality**: Proves resistance doesn't require quality sacrifice
