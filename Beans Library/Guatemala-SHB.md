## 📋 Overview

Guatemala SHB (Strictly Hard Bean) represents Guatemala's highest altitude-grown coffee, classified by elevation rather than bean size. The "Hard Bean" designation refers to the density achieved through slow maturation at high altitudes, resulting in complex, vibrant, and sought-after coffees that showcase Guatemala's exceptional terroir.

**What "Strictly Hard Bean" Means**:
- **Not about hardness**: Refers to bean density, not physical hardness
- **Altitude requirement**: Must be grown at 1,350+ meters (4,500+ feet) above sea level
- **Slow maturation**: Cooler temperatures at altitude slow cherry development
- **Dense beans**: Slower growth creates denser, more flavor-packed beans
- **Quality indicator**: Generally correlates with superior cup quality
- **Premium grade**: Highest classification in Guatemalan grading system

**Guatemala's Grading System**:
1. **SHB** (Strictly Hard Bean): 1,350+ MASL - **Highest Quality**
2. **HB** (Hard Bean): 1,200-1,350 MASL
3. **SH** (Semi-Hard Bean): 1,050-1,200 MASL
4. **EPW** (Extra Prime Washed): 900-1,050 MASL
5. **PW** (Prime Washed): 750-900 MASL
6. **EGW** (Extra Good Washed): 600-750 MASL
7. **GW** (Good Washed): Below 600 MASL

**Why SHB Matters**:
- Altitude creates ideal stress conditions for flavor development
- Cooler temperatures slow maturation, allowing sugars to develop
- High diurnal temperature variation enhances complexity
- Dense beans roast more evenly and consistently
- International buyers specifically seek SHB designation
- Commands premium pricing in commodity and specialty markets

## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Fully Washed (Traditional) - 85-90% of SHB

**Guatemala's Signature Process**:

1. **Selective Harvesting**
   - Hand-picking only ripe red cherries
   - Multiple passes during harvest season
   - December-April main harvest
   - Family labor or hired pickers

2. **Wet Mill Processing** (Same day as harvest)
   - **Depulping**: Skin removed mechanically
   - **Fermentation**: 12-48 hours (altitude-dependent)
     - Higher altitude = longer fermentation (cooler temps)
     - Tanks or fermentation channels
     - Monitored by touch and water clarity
   - **Washing**: Multiple rinses remove mucilage
     - Clean water channels traditional
     - Density separation (floaters removed)
   - **Soaking**: Some farms add final soak (12-24 hrs)

3. **Drying**
   - **Patio Drying** (Traditional):
     - Brick or concrete patios
     - 7-14 days depending on weather and altitude
     - Raked regularly for even drying
     - Covered at night and during rain
   - **Raised Beds** (Specialty farms):
     - African-style drying beds
     - Better airflow, slower drying
     - Premium quality development
     - 10-18 days
   - **Guardiolas** (Mechanical):
     - Used in wet climates (Cobán especially)
     - Rotating drum dryers
     - Faster but requires skill to avoid "baker" defect
     - 48-72 hours
   - **Target**: 10.5-12% moisture content

4. **Dry Milling**
   - Parchment removed (hulling)
   - Size grading
   - Density sorting
   - Color sorting (defect removal)
   - Hand-sorting for final quality control
   - Export preparation

**Flavor Impact of Washing**:
- Clean, bright, articulate flavors
- High acidity (citric, malic)
- Clarity of terroir and variety
- Balanced sweetness
- Medium to full body
- Classic Guatemalan profile

### Natural/Dry Process (5-10% of SHB, Growing)

**Modern Innovation**:
- Traditionally rare in Guatemala (rainy climate challenges)
- Increasing in dry regions (Huehuetenango, Antigua)
- Specialty micro-lots focus

**Process**:
- Whole cherries dried on patios or raised beds
- 20-30 days drying time
- Careful monitoring to prevent mold/fermentation defects
- Removed to dry mill when dried

**Flavor Impact**:
- Fruity, berry notes
- Full, syrupy body
- Lower acidity than washed
- Sweet, complex
- Not traditional for Guatemala but excellent when done well

### Honey/Pulped Natural (3-5%, Emerging)

**Recent Experimentation**:
- Skin removed, mucilage left on
- Dried with sticky mucilage intact
- 10-20 days drying

**Flavor Impact**:
- Between washed and natural
- Sweet, complex
- Fruit notes present but cleaner than full natural
- Medium-full body

### Roasting SHB Coffee

**Density Considerations**:
- SHB beans are very dense (high altitude = slow growth)
- Requires more heat energy to develop
- Longer roast times than lower-altitude coffees
- Risk of uneven roasting if heat too high
- Benefits from moderate, steady heat application

**Recommended Profile**:
1. **Charge Temperature**: 390-410°F (199-210°C)
2. **Drying Phase**: 5-6 minutes to yellow
3. **Browning Phase**: 4-5 minutes to first crack
4. **First Crack**: 10-12 minutes total time
5. **Development Time**: 
   - Light: 60-90 seconds post-crack
   - Medium: 90-150 seconds
   - Medium-Dark: 150-210 seconds
6. **Drop Temperature**:
   - Light: 405-412°F (207-211°C)
   - Medium: 415-425°F (213-218°C)
   - Medium-Dark: 425-435°F (218-224°C)

**Tips**:
- Don't rush SHB - density requires time
- Watch for scorching (high heat on dense exterior)
- Development phase critical for sweetness
- Guatemalan SHB forgives slight over-roasting better than under
