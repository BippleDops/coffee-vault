## 🌱 The Gesha Variety

### Botanical Characteristics

**Plant Appearance**:
- **Height**: Tall, often 3-5 meters (10-16 feet) - distinctively tall
- **Leaves**: Long, elongated, bronze-tipped when young
- **Internodes**: Wide spacing between branches (distinctive identifier)
- **Cherries**: Elongated, pointed shape
- **Beans**: Long, narrow, boat-shaped
- **Growth**: Slow, lanky, sprawling habit

**Agricultural Challenges**:
- **Yield**: Very low compared to modern varieties (30-50% of Caturra)
- **Management**: Tall plants difficult to harvest and prune
- **Disease**: Surprisingly resistant to coffee leaf rust (why originally collected)
- **Spacing**: Requires more space due to size
- **Wind**: Susceptible to wind damage (tall, thin branches)
- **Economics**: Only viable at ultra-premium specialty prices

- **Recognition**: Cachet of Gesha name
- **Quality**: Unmatched cup quality when grown well
- **Niche**: Ultra-premium specialty market demand

### Genetic Diversity

**Ethiopian Wild-Type Gesha** vs. **Panama Geisha (1931 Collection)**:

**Ethiopian Gesha (Wild-type)**:
- Diverse genetics from multiple wild trees
- **Population, not single clone**
- Continuous evolution in native habitat
- Varying plant morphology and cup profiles
- Maximum genetic diversity
- Represents natural Gesha expression
- Adaptable, resilient

**Panama Geisha (1931 Single Selection)**:
- **Genetic bottleneck**: From limited original seed collection
- Single line propagated for 90+ years
- Uniform plant characteristics
- Consistent (but narrow) cup profile
- Selected for specific flavors over decades in Panama terroir

## 🔥 Roasting Ethiopian Gesha

### Optimal Roast Levels

**Light Roast (City, City+)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **ESSENTIAL**
- **Only recommended roast for Ethiopian Gesha**
- Preserves delicate floral notes
- Maximizes complexity
- Highlights terroir and variety
- Bright acidity fully expressed
- **Any darker = waste of expensive coffee**

**Medium Roast (Full City)** ⭐⭐
- **Not recommended**
- Loses floral character
- Jasmine diminishes
- Acidity muted
- Defeats purpose of Gesha
- Save your money if roasting medium

**Medium-Dark or Dark** ⭐ **Never**
- Absolute waste of Gesha
- All unique characteristics destroyed
- Might as well use commodity coffee
- Roast flavors dominate completely
- Professional roasters will judge you

### Roasting Gesha: Challenges & Techniques

**Unique Roasting Characteristics**:
- **Low Density** (despite high altitude):
  - Long, narrow beans = lower density than expected
  - Absorbs heat quickly
  - Can scorch easily
- **Delicate Flavor Compounds**:
  - Floral compounds volatile, easily destroyed
  - Narrow roast window for optimal expression
  - Easy to over-roast even slightly
- **High Price = High Pressure**:
  - Every roast must be perfect (expensive mistakes)

**Recommended Light Roast Profile**:
1. **Charge Temperature**: 380-395°F (193-202°C) - moderate
2. **Drying Phase**: Gentle, 5-6 minutes to yellow
3. **Browning**: Moderate heat increase, 3-4 minutes to first crack
4. **First Crack**: 9-11 minutes total time
5. **Development**: **30-60 seconds post-crack only**
   - Extremely short development
   - Drop just into or very early in first crack
   - Preserves floral compounds
6. **Drop Temperature**: 400-408°F (204-209°C)
   - City to City+ roast level
   - Light brown color
   - No second crack approach

**Critical Tips**:
- **Less is more**: Under-develop rather than over-develop
- **Sample roast first**: Learn the coffee before committing
- **Small batches**: Easier control, less financial risk
- **Cool immediately**: Rapid cooling preserves florals
- **Rest 3-7 days**: Gesha needs rest but not too long
- **Seal and protect**: Oxidation destroys floral notes quickly

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Over-developing**: Most common error, ruins Gesha
- **Too much heat**: Scorching delicate beans
- **Too dark**: Even Full City is too dark for many Geshas
- **Rushing**: Needs proper time despite light roast
- **Stale roasting**: Old green coffee = diminished florals

- Requires very light espresso roast
- Parameters: 18g in, 45-50g out (1:2.5+), 25-30s
- Temperature: 200-202°F
- **Result**: Intense florals, syrupy body, complex BUT...
- **Arguments Against**:
  - Wastes Gesha's delicacy
  - Costs $5-10+ per shot
  - Pour-over shows Gesha better
- **Arguments For**:
  - Incredible when done right
  - Concentrated florals unforgettable
  - Unique experience
- **Verdict**: Try once if you can afford it, but pour-over is better value

**Cold Brew** ⭐ **Don't Even Think About It**
- Complete waste of Gesha
- Loses all florals

- Consider hand grinder for best quality (e.g., Comandante)

**Temperature**:
- **200-205°F** (93-96°C) optimal
- Hotter = better extraction of complex compounds
- Cooler if acidity too intense for your palate
- Don't go below 195°F (91°C)

**Brew Time**:
- Not too fast (under-extraction = sour, thin)
- Not too slow (over-extraction = bitter, harsh)
- **Sweet spot**: 2:45-3:15 for most pour-overs

**Tasting Notes**:
- Let coffee cool to room temperature
- Gesha transforms as it cools (dramatic evolution)
- Best flavors often emerge at 140-160°F (60-71°C)
- Cold Gesha still delicious (unlike most coffee)
- Taste at multiple temperatures for full experience
