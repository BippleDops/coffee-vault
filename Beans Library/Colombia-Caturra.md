## 📋 Overview

Colombia Caturra represents Colombian coffee's golden era (1970s-2000s) - a compact Bourbon mutation combining excellent cup quality with better productivity than traditional varieties. While being replaced by rust-resistant Castillo, Caturra remains the quality benchmark for Colombian coffee and the variety specialty buyers seek.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Bourbon Quality**: Maintains Bourbon sweetness, complexity, balance
- **Compact Size**: Half the height of Bourbon (easier harvest, higher density planting)
- **Better Yield**: 30-40% more productive than Bourbon
- **Bright Profile**: Brighter, more acidic than Bourbon (characteristic)
- **Declining**: Being replaced by Castillo (rust resistance)
- **Specialty Favorite**: Roasters specifically seek Caturra lots
- **Premium**: Commands premiums over Castillo

**Historical Role**:
- **1937**: Discovered in Brazil (Bourbon mutation)
- **1950s-1960s**: Introduced to Colombia
- **1970s-1990s**: Became dominant Colombian variety (40-50% of production)
- **Peak**: 1980s-2000s, defined Colombian coffee quality
- **2010s**: Coffee rust epidemics forced replacement with Castillo
- **Present**: ~25-35% of production, declining but valued for quality
- **Future**: Likely to continue declining but persist in specialty sector
