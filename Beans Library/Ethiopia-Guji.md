## 🔥 Roasting Guji

**Light Roast (City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **IDEAL FOR WASHED**:
- **30-60 seconds post-crack** development
- Preserves peach, floral, complexity
- Bright acidity fully expressed
- Drop: 402-410°F (206-210°C)

**Light-Medium (City+)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **IDEAL FOR NATURAL**:
- **60-90 seconds development**
- Balances fruit with developing chocolate
- Drop: 410-418°F (210-214°C)

**Medium (Full City)** ⭐⭐⭐:
- **Trade-off**: Sweetness increases, stone fruit diminishes
- Acceptable but loses Guji magic

**Anything Darker**: ⭐⭐ Waste of Guji's unique character

**Verdict**: Light to light-medium essential. Don't roast dark.
