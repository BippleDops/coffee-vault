## 📋 Overview

Catimor is coffee's commodity workhorse - rust-resistant hybrid combining Caturra with Timor Hybrid to create productive, disease-resistant plants that sacrifice cup quality for agricultural practicality. While specialty coffee generally avoids Catimor, it enables economically viable coffee farming in challenging conditions and forms foundation of commodity market.

- **Commodity**: Primary use in commercial/commodity production
- **Global**: Grown worldwide (especially Asia, Central America)
- **Economic**: Enables profitable farming without specialty premiums

**Development**:
- **1950s-1960s**: Created by crossing Caturra × Timor Hybrid
