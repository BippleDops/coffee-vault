## 🌱 The Catuai Variety

### Genetic Background

**Hybrid Development**:
- **Parents**: 
  - **Caturra**: Bourbon mutation, compact, good quality, low yield
  - **Mundo Novo**: Typica × Bourbon natural hybrid, high yield, robust
- **Cross**: Caturra × Mundo Novo = Catuai
- **Goal**: Combine Caturra's quality + compactness with Mundo Novo's productivity
- **Success**: Achieved both goals, widely adopted
- **Release**: 1970s by IAC (Instituto Agronômico de Campinas), Brazil
- **Variants**: Red Catuai and Yellow Catuai (cherry color variants)

**Plant Characteristics**:
- **Height**: Compact, short (2-2.5 meters vs. 3-4m for traditional Bourbon)
- **Internodes**: Short spacing between branches
- **Branching**: Dense, lateral branches strong and numerous
- **Cherries**: Red or yellow (two color variants)
- **Leaves**: Dark green, medium size
- **Roots**: Strong, deep (drought tolerance moderate)

**Agricultural Advantages**:
- **Wind Resistance**: Short, strong branches resist wind damage (critical for open plateaus)
- **Density Planting**: Compact size allows more plants per hectare
- **Mechanization**: Uniform ripening and size enable mechanical harvesting
- **Yield**: High yield comparable to modern hybrids
- **Quality**: Maintains good cup quality (rare for high-yield varieties)
- **Adaptability**: Grows well 800-1,400 MASL (wide range)

**Challenges**:
- **Disease**: Susceptible to coffee leaf rust (like most Arabicas)
- **Requires Fertilization**: High productivity demands nutrients
- **Pests**: Susceptible to coffee berry borer
- **Not Ultra-Premium**: Good quality but not competition-winning complexity

**Why Widely Adopted**:
- Balances quality, yield, resilience
- Economically viable for farmers
- Works in mechanized and manual systems
- Reliable, predictable production
- International market acceptance

## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Natural (Dry) Processing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Brazilian Specialty**

**Brazil's Strength**:
Brazil perfected large-scale natural processing, and Catuai excels in this method.

**Process**:
1. **Harvest**: 
   - **Mechanical** (common for Catuai in Cerrado): Strip-picking entire branches
   - **Selective** (smaller farms): Hand-picked ripe cherries only
2. **Sorting**: Floatation tanks remove under-ripe and defects
3. **Drying**:
   - **Patios** (traditional): Concrete or brick, raked daily, 15-25 days
   - **Raised African Beds** (specialty): Better airflow, 20-30 days
   - **Mechanical Pre-Drying** (some farms): Guardiolas for initial moisture removal
4. **Storage**: Dried cherries stored in warehouse
5. **Dry Milling**: Fruit removed when ready to export/roast

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Sweetness**: Extreme - fruit sugars penetrate bean
- **Chocolate**: Dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, cocoa powder
- **Dried Fruit**: Raisin, date, fig, dried berry
- **Body**: Full to very full, syrupy, creamy
- **Acidity**: Very low, smooth, gentle
- **Complexity**: Deep chocolate-fruit complexity
- **Clean**: Brazilian natural processing is cleanest in world (dry climate advantage)

### Pulped Natural (Semi-Washed / Honey) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Brazil's Innovation**:
Brazil invented pulped natural processing, and Catuai performs excellently.

**Process**:
1. **Harvest**: Mechanical or selective
2. **Depulping**: Skin removed mechanically, mucilage left on
3. **Drying**: Sticky beans dried with mucilage intact
   - Patios or raised beds
   - 12-20 days
   - Raked frequently to prevent mold
4. **Dry Milling**: Dried mucilage removed

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Balance**: Between washed and natural
- **Sweetness**: High (higher than washed, lower than natural)
- **Chocolate**: Milk chocolate, caramel
- **Fruit**: Subtle, clean fruit notes (not extreme)
- **Body**: Medium-full, smooth
- **Acidity**: Low-medium (more than natural, less than washed)
- **Clarity**: Better than natural, more body than washed
- **Versatility**: Excellent for blending

### Washed Processing (Less Common) ⭐⭐⭐

**Rare for Catuai in Brazil**:
- Brazilian climate favors natural/pulped natural
- Washed processing requires significant water (scarce in some regions)
- Mostly used for specific export markets or specialty requests

**When Used**:
- Specialty micro-lots
- Boutique farms with water access
- European market preference

**Flavor Impact**:
- **Clarity**: High, clean, bright
- **Acidity**: Higher than natural (but still low for coffee generally)
- **Chocolate-Nuts**: Primary flavors
- **Body**: Medium, lighter than natural
- **Different**: Loses classic Brazilian character somewhat
