## 📋 Overview

Guatemala Typica represents coffee's original genetics expressed through Guatemala's ideal volcanic terroir - the tall, low-yielding, exceptionally complex variety that defined coffee quality for centuries, now maintained only on heritage farms where its outstanding cup quality justifies agricultural challenges.

**Why Typica Matters**:
- **Original Variety**: Genetic foundation of global coffee (brought from Yemen/Ethiopia to Java to Americas 1700s)
- **Exceptional Quality**: Unmatched complexity, clarity, balance
- **Heritage**: Represents historical coffee, genetic preservation
- **Guatemala's Best**: When found, delivers Guatemala's finest expression
- **Rare**: <5% of production (low yield makes it economically challenging)
- **Competition**: Typica lots win competitions when entered
- **Premium**: Commands significant premiums
- **Genetic Resource**: Important for coffee breeding programs globally

**Historical Journey**:
- **1700s**: Typica brought from Java to Americas
- **Guatemala**: Arrived early-mid 1700s, became established
- **1800s-1900s**: Dominant variety in Guatemala
- **Peak**: Pre-1950, 70-80% of Guatemalan coffee was Typica
- **Decline**: Replaced by more productive varieties (Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai)
- **Present**: ~3-5% of production, heritage farms only
- **Status**: Endangered commercially, preserved for quality

## 🔥 Roasting Guatemala Typica

**Light Roast (City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **RECOMMENDED**:
- **Highlights**: Floral, stone fruit, complexity, terroir
- Preserves delicate compounds
- Maximum origin expression
- **Development**: 45-75 seconds post-crack
- **Drop**: 405-412°F (207-211°C)
- **Best For**: Pour-over, showcasing Typica's unique character

**Light-Medium (City+)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **ALSO EXCELLENT**:
- **Balance**: Floral + developing chocolate-caramel
- Broader appeal than pure light
- Still complex, more approachable
- **Development**: 75-105 seconds
- **Drop**: 412-420°F (211-216°C)

**Medium (Full City)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐:
- **Trade-Off**: Chocolate develops, florals diminish
- Still good but loses some Typica magic
- More traditional Central American profile
- **Development**: 105-150 seconds

**Medium-Dark or Darker** ⭐⭐:
- **Not Recommended**: Masks Typica's unique characteristics
- Wastes premium coffee
- Better varieties for darker roasts
- **Only if**: Personal preference overrides origin expression

**Roasting Considerations**:
- **Very Tall Beans**: Long, narrow beans = potential uneven roasting
- **Lower Density**: Than Bourbon (roasts slightly faster)
- **Delicate Compounds**: Florals and stone fruit easily destroyed
- **Short Development**: Preserve complexity with moderate development
- **Cool Quickly**: Rapid cooling locks in aromatics
