# Kenya Nyeri SL28 Washed

## Overview

Kenya Nyeri SL28 Washed represents the pinnacle of what makes Kenyan coffee among the most distinctive and celebrated in the specialty coffee world. This coffee combines the legendary SL28 variety—bred specifically for the Kenyan highlands and known for its intense fruit character and complex acidity—with the meticulous double-fermentation washed processing that Kenya has perfected, all grown at ideal elevations in the renowned Nyeri region's volcanic soils. The result is a coffee of extraordinary intensity, clarity, and complexity that stands apart from all other coffee origins.

The blackcurrant note that dominates this coffee's flavor profile is the definitive marker of exceptional Kenyan coffee and particularly of well-expressed SL28. This isn't subtle fruit or generic berry—it's an unmistakable, intense blackcurrant character with the slightly savory, complex quality of the actual fruit. This blackcurrant intensity, combined with bright tomato acidity (a characteristic note in many Kenyan coffees that initially surprises tasters but becomes a beloved signature), creates an immediately recognizable Kenyan profile.

Nyeri region, located in Kenya's Central Highlands on the slopes of Mount Kenya, has established itself as one of Kenya's premium coffee zones through consistent production of high-scoring, intensely flavored coffees. The combination of volcanic soils rich in minerals, high altitudes creating slow cherry maturation, and a strong cooperative system ensuring quality processing makes Nyeri coffees particularly sought-after in the specialty market.

The Gatomboya Farmers Cooperative represents approximately 1,400 smallholder farmers cultivating coffee on plots typically ranging from 0.25 to 2 hectares. This cooperative model is standard in Kenya and has been instrumental in maintaining quality standards and ensuring fair compensation for producers. The cooperative operates centralized wet mills where members deliver their day's cherry harvest for processing, ensuring fresh cherries and standardized processing that creates the consistency Kenyan coffees are known for.

SL28 is a variety developed by Scott Laboratories (hence the "SL" designation) in Kenya in the 1930s specifically for high-altitude Kenyan growing conditions. The variety was selected for drought tolerance, quality cup characteristics, and adaptation to Kenya's climate rather than for yield or disease resistance. This quality-first breeding approach created a variety that produces exceptional coffee but requires careful management and commands premium prices to offset lower productivity. SL28's genetic background includes Bourbon and possibly Yemeni varieties, creating a unique genotype that expresses itself distinctively in Kenya's terroir.

The double-fermentation processing method employed in Kenya involves two separate fermentation stages with washing between, creating incredibly clean coffee with complex acidity and intense fruit character. This processing is labor-intensive and requires substantial water and infrastructure, but the results justify the effort—Kenyan washed coffees processed through this method show clarity and brightness unmatched by coffees from other origins.

At 1,700-1,850 meters elevation on the slopes of Mount Kenya, the coffee benefits from cool temperatures, volcanic soil fertility, and the day/night temperature swings that create dense, complex coffee beans. The altitude combined with Kenya's equatorial location (straddling the equator) creates ideal photosynthesis conditions—intense sun exposure for energy production combined with cool temperatures that slow respiration and allow the tree to accumulate rather than consume sugars.

George Howell Coffee, the roaster behind this offering, is legendary in specialty coffee circles for pioneering direct trade relationships and championing African coffees—particularly Kenyan—in the American market. Founder George Howell was instrumental in bringing the first Kenyan coffees to the U.S. specialty market in the 1970s and has maintained relationships with Kenyan cooperatives for decades. His roasting approach emphasizes origin expression through light roast profiles that preserve the intense fruit and acidity that make Kenyan coffees special.

The sensory profile is immediately and unmistakably Kenyan. The dry aroma reveals intense blackcurrant with tomato leaf and grapefruit zest. In the cup, the blackcurrant dominates with realistic fruit intensity, supported by bright tomato acidity that adds savory complexity. The acidity is phosphoric—smooth, sweet, and intensely bright—providing incredible structure and liveliness. Grapefruit and citrus notes add complexity while brown sugar sweetness balances the acidity. The body is remarkably full for a washed, lightly roasted coffee—almost syrupy in texture—creating satisfying mouthfeel that carries the intense flavors beautifully.

The finish is extraordinarily long and complex, evolving through multiple phases from fruit through savory tomato to sweet citrus, persisting for 45+ seconds with lingering blackcurrant sweetness. The clean cup quality is impeccable with zero defects—a testament to Kenya's processing excellence and the roaster's quality control.

This coffee represents exceptional value despite premium pricing. At $26 for 340g, it's among the more expensive coffees in most specialty lineups, but the 89-point cupping score, distinctive SL28 character, and meticulous Kenyan processing justify the cost. For those seeking to understand what makes Kenyan coffee special or to experience SL28 at its best, this represents an essential reference point.
