# 🫘 Colombia Excelso

**Origin**: Colombia  
**Grade**: Excelso (Screen Size 14-16)  
**Processing**: Washed (Wet Processing)  
**Typical Altitude**: 1,200-1,900 MASL  
**Primary Varieties**: Caturra, Castillo, Colombia

---

## 📋 Overview

Colombia Excelso represents the standard export-grade Colombian coffee, comprising beans that pass through screen sizes 14, 15, and 16 (approximately 5.5-6.75mm diameter). This is Colombia's most widely exported coffee grade, accounting for the majority of Colombian coffee in the international market.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Standard Colombian export grade (not premium size like Supremo)
- Represents consistent Colombian quality at accessible pricing
- Smaller bean size than Supremo but equal or superior cup quality
- Often from slightly lower altitudes or mixed-grade lots
- Excellent value proposition in specialty market
- Foundation of Colombian coffee's global reputation

While "Excelso" sounds premium, it's actually the industry-standard size grade below Supremo. However, size doesn't determine quality - many exceptional Cup of Excellence and specialty lots are graded Excelso due to varietal characteristics or growing conditions that produce smaller beans.

**Misconception Alert**: Excelso is NOT inferior to Supremo in flavor. Bean size is independent of cup quality. Some of Colombia's finest coffees are Excelso grade.

## 📏 Understanding the Excelso Grade

### Colombian Grading System Explained

Colombian coffee grading is based on **physical bean size**, not cup quality:

**Size Classifications**:
1. **Supremo**: Screen 17+ (≥6.75mm) - Largest beans
2. **Excelso**: Screen 14-16 (5.5-6.75mm) - Standard export
3. **UGQ** (Usual Good Quality): Mixed smaller sizes
4. **Caracol/Peaberry**: Round beans (separate classification)

**Screen Size Breakdown**:
- **Screen 16**: 6.3-6.75mm (upper Excelso, nearly Supremo)
- **Screen 15**: 5.95-6.3mm (mid-range Excelso)
- **Screen 14**: 5.5-5.95mm (lower Excelso, most common)

**Why Beans Are Excelso Size**:
1. **Variety characteristics**: Some varieties naturally produce smaller beans
2. **Altitude and stress**: Extreme altitude can produce smaller, denser beans
3. **Tree age**: Younger trees often produce smaller beans
4. **Growing conditions**: Nutrient stress or challenging conditions
5. **Crop load**: Heavy yields may result in smaller bean size
6. **Genetics**: Natural variation within varieties

**Important Note**: Cup quality is determined by altitude, variety, processing, and terroir - NOT bean size. Many exceptional coffees are Excelso grade.

## 🌱 Varieties Common in Excelso Coffee

### Dominant Varieties

**Castillo** (40-50% of Excelso production):
- Colombian rust-resistant hybrid (released 2005)
- Developed by Cenicafé (Colombian Coffee Research Center)
- Cross: Caturra x Timor Hybrid (Arabica x Robusta backcross)
- **Characteristics**: Disease resistance, good yield, decent cup quality
- **Size**: Tends toward Excelso rather than Supremo
- **Flavor**: Balanced, nutty, chocolate, moderate acidity
- **Importance**: Saved Colombian coffee industry from devastating rust epidemics

**Caturra** (30-40% of Excelso):
- Bourbon mutation, compact growth habit

- Excellent cup quality at altitude
- **Size**: Variable, often produces Excelso-grade beans
- **Flavor**: Sweet, balanced, classic Colombian profile
- **Challenge**: Susceptible to coffee leaf rust

## 🔄 Processing: Colombian Washed Method

### Traditional Wet Processing

Colombia's signature washed processing creates the clean, balanced profile Excelso is known for:

**Harvest Process**:
- **Timing**: Two annual harvests in many regions
  - **Main harvest**: October-February
  - **Mitaca** (smaller harvest): April-June
- **Method**: Selective hand-picking of ripe cherries only
- **Quality control**: Multiple passes to ensure ripeness
- **Challenge**: Labor-intensive on steep mountain slopes

**Wet Mill Processing**:

1. **Reception & Sorting** (Day 1, within hours of picking)
   - Cherries delivered to farm or cooperative wet mill
   - Floatation tank removes unripe/defective cherries
   - Immediate processing to prevent fermentation

2. **Depulping** (Day 1)
   - Mechanical disc pulpers remove skin and most fruit
   - Mucilage layer remains attached to parchment
   - Separation by density (ripe sink, unripe float)

3. **Fermentation** (12-36 hours, Day 1-2)
   - Beans in fermentation tanks with or without water
   - Natural enzymes break down mucilage
   - Duration depends on temperature and altitude
   - Higher altitude = longer fermentation (cooler temps)
   - Monitored by touch and visual inspection
   - Over-fermentation creates defects (vinegar, fermented flavors)
   - Under-fermentation leaves residual mucilage

4. **Washing** (Day 2)
   - Running water removes fermented mucilage
   - Washing channels with gradient
   - Final density separation (floaters removed)
   - Clean parchment coffee emerges

5. **Drying** (7-15 days, Day 2-17)
   - **Mechanical drying** (Guardiola dryers): Common due to rain
     - Rotating drum dryers, temperature-controlled
     - Faster but requires careful management to avoid "baker" defect
   - **Parabolic solar dryers**: Greenhouse-style, increasingly popular
     - Protects from rain, uses solar heat
     - Better quality than mechanical, faster than open air
   - **Raised beds**: Premium specialty processing
     - Slower drying, more labor
     - Best flavor development
     - Weather-dependent
   - **Target moisture**: 10-12% for export and storage

6. **Dry Milling** (At export facility)
   - **Hulling**: Parchment layer removed
   - **Screen sorting**: Beans separated by size (Excelso vs Supremo)
   - **Density sorting**: Catador (gravity separator)
   - **Electronic sorting**: Color and defect removal
   - **Hand sorting**: Final quality control for specialty lots
   - **Grading**: Classification as Excelso based on screen size 14-16

**Impact on Flavor**:
- Clean, articulate flavor profile
- Bright acidity (citric, malic acids)
- Clarity of terroir characteristics
- Balanced sweetness and body
- Minimal fruit/ferment notes (unlike natural processing)
- Consistent cup quality batch-to-batch
