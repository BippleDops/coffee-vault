## 📋 Overview

Ethiopia Harrar (also spelled Harar) is one of coffee's most historic and polarizing origins - exclusively dry-processed (natural) coffee from eastern Ethiopia's ancient Islamic city, producing intensely fruity, wine-like, sometimes funky coffees with wild blueberry character that divides coffee lovers into passionate devotees and complete avoiders.

- **Full Body**: Very full-bodied, syrupy, coating mouthfeel
- **Traditional**: Ancient processing methods preserved
- **Variability**: Lot-to-lot variation higher than washed Ethiopian coffees
- **Polarizing**: Extreme reactions - love intensely or dislike strongly

**The "Harrar Funk"**:
- **Descriptor**: Earthy, fermented, wine-like, sometimes barnyard notes
- **Source**: Natural processing in dry climate, specific fermentation/drying
- **Division**: 
  - **Fans**: Find it complex, interesting, terroir expression, desirable
  - **Critics**: Find it defect, off-flavor, unclean, unpleasant
- **Reality**: Characteristic of Harrar, not defect (when done well)
- **Spectrum**: Ranges from subtle to intense depending on lot
