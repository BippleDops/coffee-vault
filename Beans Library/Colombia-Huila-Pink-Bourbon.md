# Colombia Huila Pink Bourbon

## Overview

The Colombia Huila Pink Bourbon represents one of the most exciting developments in modern Colombian specialty coffee—a rare variety expressing exceptional cup quality and distinctive flavor characteristics that distinguish it from the more common Colombian coffees flooding the market. Pink Bourbon, despite its name suggesting Bourbon lineage, is actually a naturally occurring Ethiopian landrace that found its way to Colombia through uncertain historical pathways and has recently gained recognition for its outstanding sensory profile and unique pink cherry coloration.

This particular lot comes from [[Producers/Finca-El-Paraiso]], a progressive farm in the Pitalito municipality of Huila department, one of Colombia's most celebrated coffee-growing regions. Huila has emerged over the past two decades as the epicenter of Colombian specialty coffee, producing more Cup of Excellence winners than any other Colombian department and establishing a reputation for meticulous processing, altitude-driven quality, and innovative variety selection. The combination of Huila terroir, Pink Bourbon genetics, and skilled washed processing creates a coffee of remarkable complexity and sweetness.

The altitude range of 1,750-1,950 meters above sea level places this coffee firmly in the high-grown category where cooler temperatures, intense sun exposure, and volcanic soil combine to produce dense, complex coffee beans. At these elevations in Huila, coffee cherries ripen slowly over extended periods, developing concentrated sugars and organic acids that translate to vibrant sweetness and structured acidity in the cup. The diurnal temperature variation—warm days and cool nights—is particularly pronounced at this altitude, contributing to the coffee's exceptional balance.

Pink Bourbon as a variety has become increasingly sought-after by specialty roasters and coffee enthusiasts for its distinctive cup profile that emphasizes stone fruit sweetness—particularly peach and apricot—alongside delicate florals and clean, bright acidity. The variety's rarity adds to its appeal; Pink Bourbon represents a tiny fraction of Colombian coffee production, with most farms still planted in Castillo, Colombia, or Caturra varieties bred for disease resistance and productivity rather than cup quality. Farms like Finca El Paraiso that have invested in Pink Bourbon cultivation are betting on quality premiums to offset the lower yields and higher disease susceptibility that come with this heirloom variety.

The washed processing method employed for this coffee is the traditional Colombian approach, involving pulping the coffee cherries, fermenting the mucilage-covered beans in water tanks for 12-24 hours to break down the sticky fruit layer, washing thoroughly to remove all fruit residue, and then drying the clean parchment coffee on raised beds or parabolic dryers. This processing method creates clarity and brightness in the cup, allowing the variety's inherent characteristics and the terroir to express themselves clearly without the fruit-forward intensity that natural processing would add.

[[Roasters/Heart-Coffee]], the Portland-based roaster behind this offering, has built a reputation for sourcing exceptional Colombian coffees and applying roasting profiles that balance origin expression with accessibility. Their light-medium roast approach for this Pink Bourbon develops enough body and caramelization to create a approachable sweetness while preserving the delicate stone fruit and floral notes that make the variety special. This roast level also makes the coffee exceptionally versatile, performing well in both pour-over applications and as espresso—unusual for lighter roasted coffees that typically excel in one domain or the other.

The sensory profile is immediately distinctive and recognizably Pink Bourbon to those familiar with the variety. The dry aroma reveals fresh peach and apricot notes alongside brown sugar sweetness and delicate white floral hints. In the cup, the stone fruit character is pronounced and realistic—ripe peach dominates with apricot, nectarine, and hints of plum providing complexity. The sweetness is exceptional, reminiscent of brown sugar or honey with a round, syrupy quality that coats the palate pleasantly. The acidity is malic (apple-like) and bright but soft-edged, providing structure and liveliness without sharpness. The body is medium—more substantial than typical washed Colombian coffees—with a creamy, silky mouthfeel that enhances the stone fruit impression.

The finish is long and sweet with lingering peach notes and a subtle floral aftertaste that invites the next sip. Clean cup quality is excellent with no defects or processing taints, reflecting both the careful farming and processing at origin and the quality control applied by the roaster. The overall impression is of a refined, elegant coffee that's immediately approachable yet complex enough to reward careful attention and varied brewing approaches.

This coffee represents excellent value at $22 for 340 grams, particularly considering the Pink Bourbon variety's rarity and the exceptional cup quality reflected in the 88-point cupping score. Compared to generic Colombian coffees (typically $15-18/lb for quality offerings) or even named-region Colombians ($18-22/lb), this Pink Bourbon offers noticeably superior complexity and distinctive character that justifies the small premium. For those seeking to explore rare varieties or deepen their understanding of how genetics influence cup quality, this coffee provides an accessible entry point to variety-focused coffee appreciation.

The current availability and fresh roast date make this an ideal time to purchase and experience this coffee at peak quality. The light-medium roast level means the coffee will perform well with minimal rest (3-7 days post-roast) and will maintain quality for 3-4 weeks in proper storage. The versatility across brewing methods means a single bag can provide varied experiences—bright and delicate in pour-over, rich and syrupy in espresso, balanced and sweet in Aeropress—making it valuable for home brewers who enjoy experimenting with different preparation approaches.

## Origin Details

### Geographic and Regional Context

Huila department sits in southwestern Colombia, occupying a mountainous region where the Central and Eastern ranges of the Andes converge with the Magdalena River valley creating some of Colombia's most dramatic coffee-growing terrain. The department's geography is defined by extreme elevation changes, with coffee cultivation occurring on steep mountain slopes ranging from 1,200 to 2,100 meters above sea level. This topographic diversity creates numerous microclimates, each with slightly different characteristics influencing coffee quality and flavor expression.

The Pitalito municipality, where Finca El Paraiso is located, sits in southern Huila near the border with Nariño department. Pitalito has emerged as one of Huila's most important coffee zones, known particularly for high-altitude lots with exceptional complexity and sweetness. The area's proximity to the equator (approximately 1.5 degrees north latitude) combined with high elevation creates ideal conditions for coffee cultivation—consistent year-round temperatures, ample rainfall, and intense sun exposure that drives photosynthesis and sugar development in ripening cherries.

The soil throughout Huila is predominantly volcanic in origin, derived from the region's geologically recent volcanic activity. This volcanic soil is rich in minerals—particularly phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements—that support healthy coffee tree growth and contribute to the complexity found in the final cup. The soil is typically well-draining due to its porous volcanic structure, preventing waterlogging during rainy periods while retaining enough moisture to sustain trees during dry spells. The dark color of the soil aids in heat retention, moderating temperature fluctuations that could stress coffee plants.

Water availability is excellent throughout Huila, with numerous rivers and streams fed by mountain rainfall and snowmelt providing both irrigation water and essential processing water for washed coffees. The Magdalena River, one of Colombia's major waterways, has its source in the high páramo (high-altitude grassland) regions of Huila, and countless tributaries flow through coffee-growing zones. This water abundance has historically made washed processing the dominant method in Colombia, as the infrastructure for fermentation and washing is readily available.

The climate in Pitalito is classified as tropical highland, with moderate temperatures year-round moderated by altitude. Daytime temperatures at coffee-growing elevations typically range from 18-24°C (64-75°F), while nighttime temperatures drop to 10-15°C (50-59°F). This diurnal variation is crucial for coffee quality, with warm days promoting photosynthesis and cool nights slowing respiration and allowing the tree to store energy and sugars in developing cherries rather than consuming them in nighttime metabolism.

Rainfall in Huila follows a bimodal pattern with two wet seasons (April-May and October-November) and two dry periods (June-September and December-March). This pattern creates two harvest seasons in some areas, though the main harvest typically runs from September through December, with a smaller "mitaca" harvest from April to June in some microclimates. Total annual rainfall averages 1,800-2,200mm, providing ample moisture for coffee production while the distinct dry periods allow for controlled drying of parchment coffee.

### Historical Coffee Context in Huila

Huila's emergence as Colombia's premier specialty coffee region is relatively recent in historical terms. While coffee has been cultivated in the department since the early 20th century, Huila was long overshadowed by better-known regions like Antioquia, Tolima, and the historic "coffee triangle" of Caldas, Risaralda, and Quindío. Through the 1980s and 1990s, most Huila coffee was sold as generic Colombian coffee without regional recognition or quality premiums.

The transformation began in the early 2000s as specialty coffee buyers started seeking specific origins within Colombia rather than accepting the traditional "Colombian Supremo" commodity offering. Huila's combination of high altitude, volcanic soil, and careful processing began to attract attention from quality-focused exporters and roasters. The region's first Cup of Excellence win in 2005 announced Huila's arrival on the specialty coffee stage, and subsequent years saw Huila lots consistently placing in competitions and fetching premium prices.

The Colombian Coffee Federation (Federación Nacional de Cafeteros, or FNC) played a crucial role in Huila's development by investing in infrastructure, quality training, and marketing. The FNC established cupping labs, supported wet mill construction, and helped organize small producers into quality-focused cooperatives. This institutional support, combined with farmers' willingness to invest in quality over quantity, transformed Huila from an unknown region to Colombia's most celebrated specialty coffee origin in less than two decades.

Today, Huila produces approximately 20% of Colombia's total coffee output and accounts for a disproportionate share of the country's specialty coffee exports. The department has become synonymous with quality, with "Huila" functioning almost like an appellation in the specialty market—a designation that immediately signals high-grown, carefully processed, complex coffee worthy of premium pricing.

### Finca El Paraiso Profile

[[Producers/Finca-El-Paraiso]] represents the modern Colombian coffee farm—relatively small scale (15 hectares in coffee production), family-owned and operated, quality-focused, and increasingly sophisticated in variety selection and processing approaches. The farm is managed by the Rodríguez family, now in their third generation of coffee cultivation in the Pitalito area, who have transitioned from commodity production to specialty focus over the past 15 years.

The decision to plant Pink Bourbon—a rare variety with uncertain agronomic characteristics and lower yields than disease-resistant varieties—reflects the farm's commitment to quality and willingness to experiment. The Pink Bourbon trees at Finca El Paraiso were planted in 2016-2017, meaning the trees are now reaching prime production age (5-8 years) when yields stabilize and cup quality typically peaks. The planting represents approximately 2 hectares of the farm's total coffee area, with the remainder in Castillo, Caturra, and experimental plots of Geisha and other varieties.

Cultivation practices at the farm blend traditional Colombian methods with modern quality-focused approaches. Coffee is grown under shade from native trees—primarily planted nitrogen-fixing species like guamo (Inga) alongside natural forest remnants that provide biodiversity and ecosystem services. The shade levels are moderate rather than dense, allowing enough sun penetration to drive photosynthesis and cherry development while protecting trees from temperature extremes and excessive sun stress.

Fertilization follows a program developed through soil testing and agronomic consultation, with organic matter applications (coffee pulp compost, animal manure) supplemented by mineral fertilizers targeting specific nutrient deficiencies. The volcanic soil is naturally fertile but intensive coffee cultivation depletes nutrients, particularly nitrogen and potassium, requiring careful nutrient management to sustain production and quality.

Pest and disease management is primarily preventive, with careful monitoring for coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), and other threats. The Pink Bourbon variety is more susceptible to leaf rust than modern resistant varieties, requiring vigilance during humid periods when rust spreads rapidly. The farm uses selective fungicide applications when necessary but prioritizes cultural practices—pruning for airflow, timely harvesting to remove beetle breeding sites, maintaining biodiversity—over chemical interventions.

Harvest is entirely manual, with pickers making multiple passes through the same trees over the 3-4 month harvest season as different cherries reach peak ripeness. Pickers are trained to select only fully ripe cherries, identified by the Pink Bourbon variety's distinctive pink coloration at maturity (compared to the bright red of most coffee varieties). This selective picking is labor-intensive and expensive but essential to quality—unripe cherries would contribute astringent, vegetal flavors while overripe cherries might add fermentation defects.

The farm operates its own wet mill, giving the family control over the crucial processing stage that can make or break coffee quality. This investment in processing infrastructure is increasingly common among Colombian quality producers, as farm-level processing allows customization and quality control that centralized cooperative mills may not provide.

### Terroir Expression and Regional Character

The specific terroir of Finca El Paraiso—its elevation, slope, sun exposure, soil composition, and microclimate—interacts with Pink Bourbon genetics and washed processing to create this coffee's distinctive profile. Understanding these terroir factors illuminates why this coffee tastes the way it does and how it differs from other Colombian coffees or Pink Bourbons from different origins.

The elevation of 1,750-1,950 meters places the farm in the upper range of Colombian coffee cultivation, where cool temperatures slow cherry maturation and create dense, complex beans. At this altitude, atmospheric pressure is approximately 80% of sea level pressure, reducing oxygen availability and slowing all metabolic processes. For coffee, this means extended cherry development—up to 9-10 months from flowering to harvest compared to 6-7 months at lower elevations. This extended maturation allows more complete sugar development and concentration of organic acids and aromatic precursors that determine cup quality.

The volcanic soil contributes mineral complexity and specific flavor notes that Huila coffees are known for. Volcanic soils typically show good availability of phosphorus (important for root development and energy transfer), potassium (crucial for sugar transport and fruit quality), calcium (affecting acidity perception), and magnesium (central to chlorophyll and photosynthesis). These minerals influence not just tree health but the specific organic compounds that develop in the coffee cherry and eventually express themselves in cup flavor.

The microclimate at Finca El Paraiso includes consistent cloud cover during afternoons, particularly during wet season months. This cloud pattern moderates sun exposure—intense morning sun drives photosynthesis, while afternoon clouds prevent excessive heat stress and reduce water loss through transpiration. The clouds also moderate the diurnal temperature range slightly compared to locations with clearer skies, creating a stable, stress-free environment for coffee cultivation.

The terroir expression in this coffee emphasizes clean sweetness and stone fruit characteristics that are recognizably Huila while showing the Pink Bourbon variety's distinctive peach and apricot notes. The washed processing adds clarity and brightness, allowing both terroir and variety characteristics to express clearly. The overall impression is of refined Colombian coffee—clean, sweet, balanced—elevated by Pink Bourbon's unique flavor profile into something distinctive and memorable.

## Pink Bourbon Variety Information

### Botanical Background and Genetic Identity

Pink Bourbon occupies a fascinating and somewhat mysterious position in coffee variety taxonomy. Despite the "Bourbon" name suggesting lineage from the well-known Bourbon variety (itself derived from Typica and native to Bourbon Island, now Réunion), genetic analysis has revealed that Pink Bourbon is actually an Ethiopian landrace—most likely a natural mutation or selection from one of Ethiopia's numerous indigenous coffee populations.

The exact pathway by which an Ethiopian variety came to be cultivated in Colombia and called "Pink Bourbon" remains unclear. One theory suggests Pink Bourbon represents an early introduction of Ethiopian coffee to the Americas—possibly during the same historical periods when other coffee varieties were being distributed globally—that was misidentified as Bourbon due to its general appearance and cherry characteristics. Another theory proposes Pink Bourbon emerged from a cross between an Ethiopian landrace and Bourbon somewhere in coffee's complex global distribution history, though genetic evidence doesn't strongly support this hypothesis.

Recent genetic studies using molecular markers have confirmed Pink Bourbon's Ethiopian origin by comparing its genetic profile to known varieties and Ethiopian landrace populations. The variety shows genetic similarities to other Ethiopian coffees but represents a distinct genotype not identical to any cataloged Ethiopian variety. This suggests Pink Bourbon may represent a unique Ethiopian landrace that was exported at some point in coffee's history and preserved in Colombia while possibly disappearing or remaining uncataloged in Ethiopia.

The botanical characteristics that distinguish Pink Bourbon include distinctive pink-red cherry coloration at full ripeness, somewhat smaller cherry size compared to standard Bourbon, slightly elongated bean shape, and moderate to low productivity (yields approximately 30-40% less than high-yielding varieties like Castillo). The pink cherry color at maturity is the most distinctive field characteristic and the source of the variety's name—unlike the bright red of most coffee varieties or the yellow of Yellow Bourbon, Pink Bourbon cherries mature to a distinctive pink-red hue that makes them easily identifiable during harvest.

### Growing Characteristics and Agronomic Considerations

From a cultivation perspective, Pink Bourbon presents both advantages and challenges compared to more common Colombian varieties. The primary advantage is exceptional cup quality—Pink Bourbon consistently produces complex, sweet, fruity coffees that command premium prices in the specialty market. This quality premium can offset the variety's lower yields and make it economically viable despite productivity disadvantages.

The challenges include susceptibility to coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), the fungal disease that devastated Colombian coffee production in recent years and drove widespread replanting with resistant varieties. Pink Bourbon lacks the genetic resistance that varieties like Castillo (a Sarchimor hybrid bred specifically for rust resistance) possess, making it vulnerable during humid conditions favorable to rust proliferation. Farmers growing Pink Bourbon must monitor carefully for rust and be prepared to apply fungicides or implement cultural practices to manage the disease.

Productivity is moderate to low compared to high-yielding commercial varieties. Where Castillo might produce 2,500-3,000 kg of green coffee per hectare under good management, Pink Bourbon typically yields 1,500-2,000 kg/ha. This yield difference is significant economically—a farmer needs to receive 50% higher prices for Pink Bourbon to achieve the same revenue per hectare as Castillo. Fortunately, the quality premium in the specialty market often exceeds this threshold, making Pink Bourbon economically attractive despite lower volumes.

The variety shows good adaptation to high-altitude conditions, thriving in the 1,700-2,100 meter range where many commercial varieties struggle. The trees are somewhat sensitive to temperature extremes and water stress but perform well in the stable, well-watered conditions typical of premium Colombian coffee zones. Tree structure is relatively open with moderate lateral branching, requiring careful pruning to maintain productivity and facilitate harvest.

Cherry maturation is somewhat extended compared to faster-ripening varieties, with Pink Bourbon requiring approximately 8-10 months from flowering to harvest. This extended maturation is generally positive for quality, allowing more complete flavor development, but it can complicate harvest planning and may expose cherries to disease or weather risks over the longer ripening period.

### Pink Bourbon Cup Profile Characteristics

The sensory profile of Pink Bourbon has become increasingly well-defined as more lots reach the specialty market and cuppers build familiarity with the variety's distinctive characteristics. While terroir, processing, and roasting all influence final cup quality, Pink Bourbon shows consistent flavor tendencies across different origins and processing methods:

**Stone fruit dominance**: The most distinctive Pink Bourbon characteristic is pronounced stone fruit flavor, particularly peach and apricot. These notes appear in most well-processed Pink Bourbon lots and are more intense and realistic than the generic "fruity" notes found in many coffees. The stone fruit character is sweet and juicy rather than tart or acidic, contributing to the variety's overall sweetness impression.

**Exceptional sweetness**: Pink Bourbon consistently shows very high sweetness levels, often rated 9-10 on the SCA cupping form's 10-point sweetness scale. The sweetness has a brown sugar or honey-like quality that complements the stone fruit notes and contributes to the variety's accessibility and appeal.

**Floral complexity**: White floral notes—jasmine, orange blossom—are common in Pink Bourbon, particularly in washed processing where they express more clearly. These florals are delicate and refined, adding elegance and complexity without dominating the fruit-forward profile.

**Bright but soft acidity**: The acidity in Pink Bourbon is typically malic (apple-like) and phosphoric rather than citric, creating brightness and liveliness without sharp edges. The acidity is well-integrated with the high sweetness, creating balance rather than sour impressions.

**Medium body**: Pink Bourbon typically shows more body than many washed Colombian coffees, with a creamy, coating mouthfeel that enhances the stone fruit impression. The body is substantial enough to be satisfying but not heavy, maintaining elegance and drinkability.

**Clean cup and clarity**: Well-processed Pink Bourbon shows excellent clean cup characteristics with no fermentation defects or processing taints. The clarity allows all the variety's subtle characteristics to express themselves distinctly.

### Comparison to Other Bourbon Varieties

Understanding how Pink Bourbon differs from true Bourbon varieties and from other Colombian coffees helps clarify its unique position:

**vs. Red Bourbon**: Traditional Red Bourbon (the variety from which Yellow Bourbon and other Bourbon mutations derive) shows less intense fruit character and more classic "coffee" flavor—chocolate, caramel, mild fruit. Bourbon has balanced sweetness but not the exceptional sweetness of Pink Bourbon. The body is similar, and both show clean cup quality when well-processed.

**vs. Yellow Bourbon**: [[Coffee Varieties/Yellow-Bourbon]], another color mutation of Bourbon popular in Brazil, shows some fruit notes but typically emphasizes nutty, chocolatey characteristics rather than stone fruit. Yellow Bourbon's sweetness is high but has a different quality—more brown sugar and caramel rather than the fruity sweetness of Pink Bourbon.

**vs. Castillo (Colombian standard)**: [[Coffee Varieties/Castillo]], the rust-resistant hybrid that dominates Colombian production, produces clean, balanced coffee but generally lacks the complexity and distinctive fruit character of Pink Bourbon. Castillo emphasizes chocolate, caramel, and mild fruit notes with good sweetness but lower complexity.

**vs. Geisha**: [[Coffee Varieties/Geisha]], the most celebrated specialty coffee variety, shows similar floral and fruit characteristics to Pink Bourbon but with more pronounced jasmine florals and tropical fruit notes (mango, papaya) rather than stone fruit. Geisha typically shows higher complexity but also commands much higher prices—Pink Bourbon offers some Geisha-like qualities at more accessible pricing.

### Future of Pink Bourbon in Colombia

Pink Bourbon's future in Colombian coffee production appears bright despite its agronomic challenges. The variety has gained recognition among specialty roasters and consumers, creating market demand that drives prices high enough to justify cultivation despite lower yields and rust susceptibility. As long as this quality premium persists, farmers will continue planting Pink Bourbon in suitable locations.

The variety's susceptibility to leaf rust remains a concern, particularly as climate change creates conditions more favorable to rust proliferation in traditional coffee-growing regions. Farmers may need to invest more in disease management or may find Pink Bourbon becomes unsustainable in some areas as rust pressure increases. Research into rust-resistant Pink Bourbon selections or crosses that maintain cup quality while adding resistance could help secure the variety's long-term viability.

Interest from research institutions and coffee organizations in documenting and preserving Pink Bourbon genetics suggests the variety will be conserved even if commercial cultivation faces challenges. The variety represents valuable genetic material—both for its intrinsic cup quality and as a potential breeding parent for developing new varieties with improved characteristics.

For specialty coffee consumers, Pink Bourbon represents an opportunity to support variety diversity and quality-focused farming. By purchasing and appreciating Pink Bourbon coffees, consumers create market incentives for farmers to maintain diverse varieties rather than consolidating around a few high-yielding commercial options. This diversity is valuable both for flavor diversity in the specialty market and for genetic resilience in the face of climate change and disease pressures.

## Processing Method - Colombian Washed

### Overview of Colombian Washed Processing

The washed process (also called wet process) is the traditional and dominant processing method throughout Colombia, employed for approximately 90% of the country's coffee production. This processing approach involves mechanically removing the fruit (pulp) from freshly harvested coffee cherries, fermenting the mucilage-covered beans to break down the sticky layer, washing thoroughly to remove all fruit residue, and drying the clean parchment coffee to optimal moisture content. The result is a clean, bright coffee that emphasizes origin and variety characteristics rather than processing-derived flavors.

Colombian washed processing has evolved over more than a century of coffee cultivation in the country, with techniques refined to suit local conditions and quality expectations. The abundant water availability throughout Colombian coffee regions facilitated the adoption of washed processing and the development of infrastructure—wet mills, fermentation tanks, washing channels—necessary for the method.

### Cherry Reception and Initial Processing

For this Pink Bourbon lot, processing began within hours of harvest as freshly picked cherries were delivered to Finca El Paraiso's on-farm wet mill. Immediate processing is crucial for quality—cherries begin fermenting spontaneously after harvest, and delays can lead to uncontrolled fermentation or contamination that creates defects in the final cup.

Upon arrival at the wet mill, cherries undergo flotation in water tanks to separate high-density ripe cherries from lower-density unripe or defective fruit and to remove any debris or leaves. Ripe cherries sink while defects float and are removed. This flotation serves as final quality control after the selective field picking, ensuring only optimal cherries continue to processing.

The sorted cherries then pass through a mechanical pulper (despulpador)—a machine with rotating drums or disks that squeeze cherries to separate the fruit pulp from the coffee seeds while leaving the parchment layer and mucilage intact. The pulper settings must be carefully adjusted to remove pulp effectively without damaging the delicate parchment or breaking beans, which would create defects. For Pink Bourbon's somewhat smaller cherry size, pulper calibration requires attention to ensure effective pulping without bean damage.

The removed pulp (coffee cherry skins and outer fruit layer) is collected and typically composted for use as organic fertilizer, returning nutrients to the soil and closing the loop in farm nutrient management. Progressive farms like El Paraiso increasingly treat coffee processing byproducts as valuable resources rather than waste.

### Fermentation Process

After pulping, the mucilage-covered beans (still in their parchment layer) are transferred to fermentation tanks where they undergo controlled fermentation to break down the sticky mucilage layer. This fermentation is the crucial step in washed processing, and managing it properly is essential to achieving clean cup quality and optimal flavor development.

The fermentation tanks at Finca El Paraiso are typically concrete or tiled structures that can be carefully cleaned and maintained. The beans are placed in the tanks in layers 50-80cm deep with minimal water added—just enough to keep the mass moist but not submerged (a technique called "dry fermentation" despite the name). Some Colombian processors use fully submerged fermentation, but dry fermentation has become preferred for quality lots as it concentrates the microbial activity and reduces water usage.

The fermentation is driven by naturally occurring microorganisms—primarily yeasts and lactic acid bacteria—that colonize the coffee cherries in the field and are present in the processing environment. These microbes consume the sugars and pectins in the mucilage, producing organic acids (primarily lactic acid and acetic acid), carbon dioxide, and heat as metabolic byproducts. The biochemical activity breaks down the mucilage structure, allowing it to be easily washed away after fermentation completes.

Fermentation duration is determined by temperature, ambient conditions, and the specific microbial populations present. In Huila's relatively cool climate at high altitude, fermentation typically requires 18-24 hours to complete fully. Experienced processors monitor fermentation progress by testing the mucilage texture—when it feels gritty rather than slippery and when the parchment coffee can be rubbed clean easily, fermentation is complete.

The fermentation creates organic acids and other flavor compounds that influence the final cup. Controlled fermentation produces clean acidity and clarity; over-fermentation creates sharp, vinegary, or phenolic off-flavors; under-fermentation leaves sticky residue that can create defects during drying. The skill in managing fermentation comes from knowing exactly when to halt the process to maximize clean acidity and clarity while avoiding defects.

### Washing and Grading

Once fermentation completes, the beans are washed in clean water to remove the broken-down mucilage and any remaining fruit residue. This washing typically occurs in channels or tanks where water flows over the coffee while workers agitate the beans and allow the lighter-density mucilage and defective beans to wash away.

The washing process serves as another quality control step. In addition to cleaning the beans, the turbulent washing allows natural density separation—higher density beans (which indicate better growing conditions, complete development, and quality) sink while lower density beans float and are removed. This density sorting, combined with the earlier flotation and field selection, ensures only the best beans continue through processing.

The washing water must be clean and abundant, requiring significant water volumes. A typical small wet mill processing 1,000 kg of cherries might use 5,000-10,000 liters of water for washing. Colombian coffee farms are increasingly implementing water recirculation systems and treatment to reduce water consumption and prevent contamination of local waterways—a sustainability consideration that [[Producers/Finca-El-Paraiso]] takes seriously through constructed wetlands and settling ponds that filter processing water before discharge.

### Drying Process

After washing, the clean parchment coffee (beans still encased in the parchment layer) is transferred to drying surfaces where moisture content is reduced from approximately 50-55% to the target 10-12% needed for stable storage. Drying is the final critical processing step, and managing it properly prevents defects and preserves the quality developed through careful cultivation, harvest, and wet processing.

Finca El Paraiso uses a combination of drying methods optimized for quality and weather resilience. Initial drying occurs on raised African-style drying beds—wooden or metal frames covered with mesh screens that allow airflow from below while keeping coffee elevated from ground moisture. The coffee is spread in thin layers approximately 2-3 cm deep to ensure even drying and prevent mold or fermentation.

During the first 2-3 days when moisture content is highest, the coffee is turned frequently (every 1-2 hours during daytime) to ensure even drying and prevent mold. Workers also hand-sort during turning, removing any remaining defects—damaged beans, parchment with visible defects, or foreign material. This manual quality control during drying is labor-intensive but essential to achieving zero-defect lots.

As drying progresses and moisture content drops below 20%, turning frequency can be reduced to 3-4 times daily. The coffee is covered with plastic sheeting or tarps during rain and overnight to prevent rehydration from dew or precipitation. In Huila's humid climate, managing moisture during drying is challenging, and many farms supplement sun drying with mechanical drying to ensure consistent quality.

Finca El Paraiso uses a parabolic dryer (marquesina)—a greenhouse-like structure with transparent plastic roofing that creates a warm, dry environment for coffee drying while protecting from rain. The parabolic shape sheds rain while the transparent covering admits sunlight to warm the interior. Ventilation openings allow moisture-laden air to escape while preventing rain entry. This controlled environment allows more consistent drying than open-air beds and reduces the risk of rain damage or mold.

Final drying may occur in mechanical guardiolas—rotating drum dryers that use heat (typically from burning coffee parchment or other biomass) to complete drying to the target 10-12% moisture content. Mechanical drying must be managed carefully to avoid over-drying (which makes beans brittle and can cause breakage during milling) or applying excessive heat (which can create baked or roasted flavors in the green coffee).

The total drying period typically ranges from 8-15 days depending on weather conditions, humidity levels, and the combination of drying methods used. Longer, slower drying is generally preferred for quality as it's gentler on the beans, though it requires more space and labor and is more susceptible to weather disruptions.

### Dry Milling and Preparation for Export

Once dried to stable moisture content, the parchment coffee (called pergamino in Colombia) enters a resting period in storage before milling. This rest—typically 30-60 days—allows moisture to equilibrate throughout the bean mass and can contribute to flavor stability and development.

Before export, the coffee undergoes dry milling to remove the parchment layer and the silver skin, revealing the green coffee bean. This milling occurs at specialized facilities with equipment designed to hull the parchment without breaking beans. The coffee passes through destoners (to remove any rocks or heavy foreign material), hullers (to remove parchment), polishers (to remove silver skin), and multiple sorting stages including density separators, screen sorters, and electronic color sorters.

High-quality lots like this Pink Bourbon also undergo manual sorting, where workers visually inspect the green coffee spread on sorting tables and remove any remaining defects—broken beans, insect-damaged beans, discolored beans, or any other quality deviations. This hand-sorting is time-consuming and expensive but essential for achieving zero-defect specialty grade coffee.

The sorted green coffee is graded according to Colombian standards, which emphasize defect count and bean size. Supremo (screen size 17 and above) and Excelso (screen size 15-16) are the primary export grades, with Supremo commanding slight premiums. This Pink Bourbon lot likely grades as Supremo based on screen size, though in the specialty market, screen size matters less than cup quality and defect-free status.

Final packaging is in GrainPro or similar hermetic bags (to protect from moisture and oxygen) inside standard jute sacks, ready for export. The coffee travels from Huila to Colombia's port cities (typically Cartagena or Buenaventura) for export to importing countries, where specialty importers warehouse the coffee in climate-controlled conditions until roasters purchase it.

### Processing Impact on Cup Profile

The washed processing method is fundamental to this coffee's flavor profile, creating the clarity and brightness that allow both Pink Bourbon variety characteristics and Huila terroir to express clearly. The thorough removal of fruit material means the cup emphasizes intrinsic bean characteristics—the variety's stone fruit sweetness, the terroir's clean acidity, the high-altitude density—rather than processing-derived fruit intensity.

Washed processing creates higher perceived acidity than natural processing of the same coffee because organic acids in the bean express more clearly without the buffering effect of fruit sugars absorbed during natural fermentation. The acidity in this coffee—bright, malic, citric—is characteristic of well-executed washed processing and is essential to the cup's liveliness and structure.

The clean cup and clarity are direct results of thorough washing and careful fermentation control. The absence of any fermentation defects, phenolic off-flavors, or processing taints reflects skilled processing and attention to detail throughout the post-harvest chain.

The medium body—more than typical washed Colombian coffees but less than a natural—represents Pink Bourbon's natural body potential enhanced by careful processing. Some of the body derives from oils and suspended solids that washing doesn't completely remove, contributing mouthfeel and texture.

Understanding the processing method helps with brewing decisions. Washed coffees generally extract more evenly and predictably than naturals, making them more forgiving in brewing. The lower soluble solids content compared to naturals means you can generally grind slightly finer or extract slightly longer without over-extraction, giving more latitude in dialing in brew parameters.

## Flavor Profile

### Dry Aroma - First Impressions

Opening the bag releases an immediate aromatic impression of fresh peach and apricot, the stone fruit character that defines Pink Bourbon expressing itself clearly even before brewing. The aroma is sweet and inviting, reminiscent of walking through a summer fruit market, with realistic fruit notes rather than candy-like artificial impressions. This pronounced dry aroma suggests high aromatic compound concentration and fresh roast quality—coffees lose aromatic intensity as they age post-roast, so the strong dry aroma indicates this coffee is at or near peak freshness.

Beyond the dominant stone fruit, the dry aroma reveals brown sugar sweetness—a warm, caramel-like note that adds depth and suggests good roast development. This brown sugar note is subtle in the dry grounds but becomes more pronounced during brewing, indicating it develops from Maillard reactions during roasting rather than being inherent in the green coffee.

White floral notes—jasmine and orange blossom primarily—weave through the fruit and sweetness, adding elegance and complexity. These florals are delicate rather than bold, requiring focused attention to detect in the dry grounds but becoming more prominent during brewing and in the cup. The floral character is never soapy or perfumed in a negative sense, maintaining a refined quality throughout.

A subtle citrus note—orange zest or tangerine—appears in the background, providing aromatic lift and foreshadowing the acidity that structures the cup. This citrus is bright and sweet rather than tart, integrating smoothly with the stone fruit dominance rather than competing.

The overall aromatic impression is clean and well-integrated, with all the noted characteristics blending smoothly rather than presenting as distinct separate elements. This integration suggests quality green coffee and skilled roasting that developed complexity without creating disjointed or competing flavors.

### Wet Aroma and Bloom

When hot water first contacts the grounds during the bloom phase of pour-over brewing (or the initial moments in any brew method), the aromatics transform dramatically as heat volatilizes aromatic compounds and water begins extracting soluble materials. The stone fruit notes intensify significantly, with fresh peach becoming the dominant aromatic element—not cooked or jammy peach, but the bright, juicy character of biting into a ripe fresh peach.

Apricot and nectarine join the peach, creating a layered stone fruit bouquet that's remarkably complex and realistic. Some cups reveal hints of plum or cherry in the background, adding depth to the fruit profile without dominating. The fruit aromatics during bloom are at their peak intensity, creating an immediately appealing impression that sets expectations for the flavor to follow.

The brown sugar sweetness becomes more prominent during bloom, with hints of honey and caramel joining the brown sugar to create a multi-dimensional sweet aromatic element. This sweetness is warm and inviting, adding richness to the fruit-forward profile without overwhelming the delicate characteristics.

The floral notes expand during bloom, with jasmine and orange blossom clearly detectable and hints of honeysuckle or rose adding complexity. These florals have a fresh, delicate quality that complements the fruit notes beautifully—the combination of stone fruit and white florals creates a harmonious, integrated aromatic profile that's distinctly Pink Bourbon.

As bloom transitions to full brewing, a subtle chocolate or cocoa note may emerge—likely a roast-developed characteristic rather than an intrinsic green coffee note—that adds depth and approachability. This chocolate is subtle and never dominates but provides a familiar anchor point that makes the coffee accessible even as the stone fruit and florals provide distinctive character.

### Flavor - Initial and Development

The first sip delivers on the aromatic promises with pronounced peach and apricot flavors dominating the initial taste. The stone fruit character is realistic and juicy, sweet with subtle tannic skin notes that add complexity and prevent the fruit from tasting one-dimensional or candy-like. The fruit intensity is immediately striking but not overwhelming—it provides distinctive character while remaining balanced and integrated with other flavor elements.

As the coffee moves across the palate, the flavor develops and reveals additional complexity. The mid-palate emphasizes the brown sugar and honey sweetness, which coats the palate pleasantly and provides continuity between the fruit-forward attack and the floral finish. This sweetness is essential to the coffee's balance—without it, the acidity and fruit notes might taste sharp or unbalanced.

Subtle chocolate and caramel notes appear in the mid-palate, adding richness and depth. These roast-developed flavors provide familiarity and accessibility, bridging the distinctive Pink Bourbon fruit characteristics with more traditional "coffee" flavors that many drinkers expect and enjoy. The chocolate is mild—milk chocolate or cocoa rather than dark chocolate—and integrates smoothly without overshadowing the fruit and floral complexity.

The floral elements—jasmine particularly—become more prominent in the later palate and finish, where they provide elegant continuation after the fruit and sweetness fade. The floral character adds sophistication and refinement, elevating the coffee from simply "fruity and sweet" to complex and distinctive.

### Acidity Profile

The acidity in this coffee is bright and lively but soft-edged, providing essential structure and liveliness without sharpness or sour impressions. The primary acid type is malic acid (the acid in apples), which creates a crisp, juicy acidity that complements the stone fruit sweetness perfectly. This malic quality is characteristic of Pink Bourbon and contributes to the fruit-forward impression.

Supporting the malic acidity is citric acid (from citrus fruits), which provides brightness and aromatic lift particularly in the finish. The citric component is less pronounced than the malic but adds complexity and prevents the acidity from being one-dimensional.

A subtle phosphoric acid note—smooth, sweet, and less sharp than citric or malic—adds depth to the acidity structure. Phosphoric acid is often found in high-quality Colombian coffees and contributes to the overall balanced, sweet acidity that Colombian washed coffees are known for.

The acidity is well-integrated with the sweetness and body, creating balance rather than competing elements. Rather than tasting separate from the other characteristics, the acidity enhances and structures the fruit and floral notes while the sweetness softens and rounds the acidity's edges. This integration is a marker of quality and of skilled roasting that developed the coffee to optimal balance.

As the cup cools from initial brewing temperature (around 70-75°C) to more moderate drinking temperature (55-65°C), the acidity becomes more pronounced and complex. Many tasters find this temperature range optimal for appreciating the coffee's full acidity profile. At cooler temperatures (below 50°C), the acidity can dominate more and some of the delicate stone fruit and floral notes recede, though the cup remains pleasant and balanced.

### Sweetness - Character and Intensity

The sweetness in this coffee is exceptional—rated "Very High" and one of the defining characteristics that makes Pink Bourbon so appealing and accessible. This sweetness is multi-layered with several distinct types expressing at different phases of the cup.

Fresh fruit sweetness—the natural fructose and sugars in the stone fruit notes—provides immediate sweetness in the initial taste. This fruit sweetness is clean and juicy, enhancing the peach and apricot character and preventing the fruit from tasting tart or acidic.

Brown sugar sweetness appears in the mid-palate, adding warmth and depth. This sweetness has a slight molasses or caramel note—likely developed through Maillard reactions during roasting rather than being intrinsic to the green coffee—that adds complexity and richness.

Honey-like sweetness emerges in the finish and aftertaste, providing long-lasting sweetness that persists well after swallowing. This lingering sweetness is particularly notable and is often mentioned by tasters as a defining characteristic. It creates a pleasant aftertaste that invites the next sip and prevents any bitter or unpleasant final notes.

The sweetness is evenly distributed throughout the cup rather than concentrated in any particular phase, providing continuity and cohesion to the flavor experience. It's present from first sip through aftertaste, creating a fundamentally sweet cup that's immediately pleasant and approachable.

The high sweetness makes this coffee particularly versatile in preparation. It performs well in pour-over where the clarity allows the sweetness to express fully. It works beautifully in espresso where the concentrated extraction intensifies the sweetness. And it creates excellent milk drinks where the coffee's natural sweetness complements milk without requiring added sugar.

### Body and Mouthfeel

The body is medium—substantial enough to be satisfying and to carry the flavor compounds effectively, but not heavy or syrupy. This body level is somewhat fuller than typical washed Colombian coffees (which tend toward medium-light) but lighter than natural-processed coffees or darker roasts. The medium body represents a sweet spot that provides presence without heaviness, allowing the complex flavors to express while contributing pleasant mouthfeel.

The texture is creamy and silky, coating the palate smoothly and creating a luxurious drinking experience. This creamy quality enhances the stone fruit impression—the mouthfeel mimics the texture of biting into a juicy peach—and adds sensory dimension beyond just flavor. The silkiness is particularly apparent in the mid-palate where the sweetness and body combine to create a rich, coating sensation.

There's no astringency or drying sensation in properly extracted cups, indicating clean processing and appropriate roast development. The finish has a subtle tannic quality—reminiscent of fruit skins or mild tea—that adds structure and complexity without crossing into unpleasant astringency. This tannic note is delicate and contributes to the complexity rather than detracting from the enjoyment.

The body shows some temperature sensitivity. At higher temperatures (above 70°C), the coffee may feel slightly thinner as thermal effects on the palate and volatility of aromatics dominate tactile perception. As the cup cools to 55-65°C, the body becomes more apparent and the creamy texture is most evident. At cool temperatures (below 45°C), the body may feel slightly thicker as oils and suspended solids become less fluid, and the subtle tannic quality becomes more pronounced.

### Finish and Aftertaste

The finish is long and complex, with multiple phases and flavor transformations extending well beyond the swallow. This extended finish is a marker of quality and complexity—simpler coffees tend to have short, single-note finishes that fade quickly.

Immediately after swallowing, the stone fruit notes linger with emphasis on peach and brown sugar sweetness. This initial finish phase lasts 10-15 seconds and maintains the primary flavor profile of the cup. The sweetness is particularly persistent, creating immediate pleasantness and satisfaction.

As the fruit notes begin to fade (15-25 seconds post-swallow), the floral elements become more prominent, particularly jasmine and orange blossom. This floral phase provides elegant transition from the fruit-forward mid-palate to a more delicate, refined finish. The florals have a clean, fresh quality that maintains interest and complexity.

In the late finish (25-40 seconds), subtle citrus notes emerge—orange zest and tangerine particularly—providing bright, aromatic closure. The citrus is sweet rather than tart, maintaining the fundamentally sweet character through the finish.

The very end of the finish (40+ seconds) is characterized by lingering honey sweetness and a subtle cocoa or chocolate note that provides a clean, pleasant final impression. There are no bitter end notes, no papery or astringent aftertaste, no off-flavors—just a graceful fade from fruit through floral to sweet, demonstrating clean cup quality and skilled processing and roasting.

The overall finish impression is of cleanliness, complexity, and sweetness. The multiple flavor transformations keep the finish interesting rather than monotonous, and the fundamental sweetness throughout makes it persistently pleasant and inviting of the next sip.

### Overall Complexity and Balance

The overall impression is of a coffee that's simultaneously distinctive and balanced, complex yet accessible. The Pink Bourbon variety provides unique character—stone fruit sweetness and floral elegance that distinguish it from standard Colombian coffees. The Huila terroir contributes clean acidity and clarity. The washed processing adds brightness and allows the variety and terroir to express clearly. And the light-medium roast balances origin expression with developed sweetness and approachability.

The complexity reveals itself through multiple cups and brewing methods. A first cup might emphasize the peach and brown sugar notes, while a second cup prepared differently might highlight florals and citrus. Different brew temperatures emphasize different characteristics. The cup evolves distinctly as it cools. This variation isn't inconsistency but rather depth—the coffee has enough complexity that different conditions emphasize different aspects, making it endlessly interesting.

The balance between competing elements is particularly well-achieved. The acidity provides structure without sourness. The sweetness offers accessibility without simplicity. The body contributes mouthfeel without heaviness. The fruit notes provide distinction without being overwhelming. No single characteristic dominates to the exclusion of others—it's a genuinely balanced coffee where all elements contribute harmoniously to the overall experience.

For cupping evaluation, this coffee would score highly on both complexity (multiple distinct flavor notes that are clear and identifiable) and balance (all elements working together harmoniously). The 88-point cupping score reflects this quality, placing it firmly in the "excellent" specialty category and indicating a coffee that delivers consistent pleasure and interest across multiple cups and evaluation rounds.

## Roasting Analysis

### Roaster Profile and Philosophy

[[Roasters/Heart-Coffee]], based in Portland, Oregon, has built its reputation on direct-trade relationships, meticulous quality control, and roasting profiles that honor origin expression while creating accessible, balanced coffees. The roastery was founded in 2009 and has grown into one of the Pacific Northwest's most respected specialty roasters, known particularly for their Central and South American coffee sourcing and their ability to create roast profiles that work across multiple brewing methods.

Heart's approach to Colombian coffees emphasizes clarity and sweetness while developing enough body and caramelization to create approachability and versatility. They avoid the extremely light roast levels that can showcase origin characteristics at the expense of balance and accessibility, instead targeting what they call "full light" or "light-medium" roast levels that preserve origin while developing sweetness and body.

### Roast Level Assessment

The roast level on this Pink Bourbon is definitively light-medium, landing in the middle ground between traditional light roast (finishing shortly after first crack) and medium roast (developing significantly after first crack). Visually, the beans show light-medium brown coloring with no oil on the surface, indicating moderate roast development without reaching the temperatures where oils migrate to the bean surface.

The roast appears even and consistent across beans, suggesting good roaster control, appropriate batch size, and proper airflow in the roasting equipment. Even roasting is essential to consistent extraction—unevenly roasted beans show variable extraction, with some beans over-extracting (contributing bitter notes) while others under-extract (contributing sour or astringent flavors).

The roast likely progressed through first crack and continued developing for 1-2 minutes after first crack ended, allowing enough time for Maillard reactions to develop sweetness and body while preserving origin characteristics. This development time is crucial—too short and the coffee tastes underdeveloped or grassy; too long and roast flavors dominate origin expression.

The Agtron measurement (standardized roast color measurement) would likely fall around 60-65 for whole bean, placing this firmly in the "light-medium" category. This level is optimal for Pink Bourbon, preserving the variety's distinctive stone fruit and floral notes while developing enough caramelization for brown sugar sweetness and chocolate notes.

### Roast Development and Flavor Impact

Despite being lighter than traditional medium roast, there's clear evidence of proper development throughout the roasting process. The coffee doesn't taste grassy, vegetal, or overly acidic as can happen with underdeveloped light roasts. The sweetness level is very high, indicating adequate Maillard reaction development of sugars and amino acids. The body is medium and satisfying, suggesting sufficient cellular breakdown during roasting.

The roast has successfully preserved the coffee's primary stone fruit and floral characteristics—the peach, apricot, and jasmine notes that define Pink Bourbon—while adding complexity through roast development. The brown sugar, honey, and subtle chocolate notes that appear in the mid-palate and finish are roast-developed characteristics that wouldn't exist in the green coffee or in extremely light roasts.

This roast level also contributes to the coffee's versatility across brewing methods. The moderate development creates enough soluble material for satisfying espresso extraction while maintaining enough acidity and clarity for excellent pour-over. This versatility is intentional—Heart Coffee designs their roast profiles to work across the full range of preparation methods their customers might use.

### Fresh Roast Considerations and Degassing

The roast date of October 25, 2024, makes this coffee seven days post-roast at the November 1 purchase date—essentially optimal for most brewing methods. Freshly roasted coffee undergoes degassing as carbon dioxide created during roasting slowly escapes from the bean structure. This degassing affects brewing, particularly in espresso where CO2 can create excessive crema and channeling.

For this light-medium roast level, peak flavor typically occurs 7-14 days post-roast. The coffee at seven days has completed most rapid degassing but flavors are still integrating and developing. Many tasters find coffees most interesting during this 7-14 day window where degassing has slowed but the coffee hasn't yet begun to stale.

The moderate roast development creates less CO2 than very dark roasts (where more complete breakdown of cellular structure releases more gas) but more than extremely light roasts. This means a moderate degassing period of 5-7 days is beneficial, but the coffee is immediately enjoyable even at 3-4 days post-roast.

### Roast Stability and Shelf Life

Light-medium roasts generally maintain peak quality for 3-4 weeks post-roast when stored properly (airtight container, room temperature, away from light and heat). This Pink Bourbon should deliver optimal flavor through approximately November 18-22, after which subtle aromatics will begin to fade though the coffee remains enjoyable.

The stone fruit and floral notes are most volatile and will fade first, typically becoming noticeably less intense by 4-5 weeks post-roast. The brown sugar sweetness and chocolate notes are more stable and may persist for 6-8 weeks, though they'll be less vibrant than at peak freshness. The structural characteristics—acidity, body, balance—are most stable and remain relatively consistent even as aromatic volatiles diminish.

The 340-gram bag size is well-suited to consuming the coffee within the optimal freshness window. At 18-20 grams per cup, the bag yields approximately 17-19 cups—about 2.5-3 weeks of daily consumption for a single-cup-per-day drinker, or 10-14 days for someone brewing twice daily. This thoughtful sizing suggests the roaster understands and prioritizes freshness.

For optimal preservation, the coffee should be stored in an airtight container immediately after opening the bag. Exposure to air accelerates staling through oxidation. If possible, store in a vacuum-sealed or one-way valve bag that allows CO2 to escape while preventing oxygen entry.

## Brewing Recommendations

### General Principles for Pink Bourbon

This Pink Bourbon coffee is notably versatile and forgiving across brewing methods, thanks to the light-medium roast level and the variety's balanced characteristics. However, understanding its particular preferences helps achieve optimal results:

**Water temperature**: 91-93°C (196-199°F) works well for most methods. This is slightly warmer than the 88-90°C often recommended for lighter roasts, reflecting the moderate development that benefits from slightly more aggressive extraction. The higher sweetness and lower astringency risk in Pink Bourbon means you can use warmer water without extracting harsh flavors.

**Grind size**: Medium to medium-fine for most methods, slightly finer than you might use for an extremely light roast. The moderate roast development created more soluble material that extracts readily, but the coffee isn't so developed that you need very coarse grinds to prevent over-extraction.

**Brew ratio**: 1:15 to 1:16.5 (coffee:water) depending on method and preference. The high sweetness means the coffee remains balanced even at higher ratios (more water per coffee) that might make other coffees taste thin or weak.

**Extraction target**: 19-21% extraction (if you measure TDS) or 2:30-3:15 total brew time for pour-over. This is moderate extraction that fully develops the coffee's characteristics without pulling harsh or bitter notes.

### Pour-Over - V60 Method (Highly Recommended)

Pour-over is the recommended preparation method for this coffee, providing clarity and brightness that showcase Pink Bourbon's stone fruit and floral characteristics while the light-medium roast provides enough body to prevent the cup from tasting thin.

**Recipe**:
- 20g coffee, medium-fine grind
- 320g water at 92°C (198°F)
- 1:16 ratio
- Total brew time: 2:45-3:00

**Process**:
1. Rinse filter and preheat V60
2. Add coffee and create shallow well
3. Bloom: 40g water, gentle swirl to saturate all grounds, wait 35 seconds
4. Main pour: Add water in slow, steady spiral pours, maintaining water level 1-2cm above coffee bed. Complete all pours by 2:15.
5. Allow full drawdown; target 2:45-3:00 total time

**Expected result**: Bright, clean cup with pronounced peach and apricot notes, brown sugar sweetness, silky body, and long floral finish. The clarity allows all the subtle characteristics to express distinctly.

**Adjustment guidance**: If the cup tastes sour or thin, grind finer or increase water temperature. If it tastes flat or bitter, grind coarser or decrease water temperature slightly.

### Espresso (Excellent Performance)

This coffee performs exceptionally well as espresso—unusual for a light-medium roast, many of which lack the body or sweetness to create balanced shots. The Pink Bourbon variety's natural sweetness and body make it espresso-appropriate even at this roast level.

**Recipe**:
- 18.5g dose in 18-20g VST basket
- 42g liquid output (1:2.27 ratio)
- 92°C water temperature
- 9 bars pressure throughout (or pressure profile: 6-7 bars pre-infusion, 8-9 bars for main extraction)
- 27-30 second total extraction time
- Medium-fine grind (espresso range, but not as fine as for dark roast)

**Expected result**: Sweet, syrupy shot with intense peach and brown sugar notes, creamy body, and bright but balanced acidity. The shot should be immediately enjoyable straight but also works beautifully in milk drinks.

**Milk drink performance**: Exceptional in cappuccino or cortado. The stone fruit notes create interesting fruit-cream complexity, while the natural sweetness means the drink rarely needs added sugar. Use in 5-6oz drinks where the coffee flavor can shine; the delicate florals may be lost in larger, milkier drinks.

### Aeropress (Versatile and Forgiving)

The Aeropress offers versatility and can emphasize different aspects of the coffee's profile depending on recipe and technique.

**Balanced Recipe** (recommended starting point):
- 17g coffee, medium grind
- 240g water at 92°C
- Inverted method
- 1:30 total time (add water, stir gently, wait 1:00, flip and press over 30 seconds)
- Medium, steady press pressure

This creates a balanced cup with good body, clear fruit notes, and pleasant acidity—somewhere between pour-over clarity and espresso intensity.

**Bright Recipe** (emphasizing acidity and fruit):
- 15g coffee, medium-fine grind
- 230g water at 93°C
- Standard orientation (not inverted)
- Add all water, stir 5 times, press immediately starting at 1:00
- Fast, gentle press

This emphasizes brightness and stone fruit, creating a cup closer to pour-over in character.

**Rich Recipe** (emphasizing body and sweetness):
- 20g coffee, medium-coarse grind
- 260g water at 90°C
- Inverted method
- 2:30 steep with gentle stir at 1:15
- Very slow press over 45 seconds

This creates a richer, sweeter cup with more body—excellent for those who find the standard profile too bright.

### French Press (Immersion Brewing)

French press creates a richer, heavier-bodied cup that emphasizes the coffee's sweetness and chocolate notes while softening the acidity. The stone fruit remains present but takes on a more compote-like character compared to the fresh fruit notes in pour-over.

**Recipe**:
- 30g coffee, coarse grind
- 480g water at 91°C (196°F)
- 1:16 ratio
- 4 minute steep time
- Gentle plunge, decant immediately

The result is a sweet, full-bodied cup with prominent brown sugar and chocolate notes alongside softer peach and floral characteristics. The silty texture from French press adds to the creamy mouthfeel.

### Cold Brew

This Pink Bourbon makes excellent cold brew, with the variety's stone fruit sweetness translating beautifully to cold extraction.

**Recipe**:
- 75g coffee, coarse grind
- 900g room temperature water
- 1:12 ratio (stronger than hot brewing)
- 18 hour steep at room temperature or refrigerated
- Filter through paper filter for clarity

**Result**: Sweet, smooth cold brew with pronounced peach and brown sugar notes. The cold extraction emphasizes sweetness and softens acidity, creating a refreshing, complex cold coffee. Serve over ice, cut 1:1 with water or milk if desired.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Sour or sharp taste**: Grind finer, increase water temperature to 93-94°C, extend brew time, or increase coffee dose. Under-extraction is likely.

**Bitter or astringent finish**: Grind coarser, reduce water temperature to 90-91°C, shorten brew time. Over-extraction is indicated.

**Flat or muted flavors**: Check coffee freshness and water quality. Increase water temperature slightly. Ensure proper brewing technique with adequate agitation.

**Thin or weak body**: Increase coffee dose (1:15 ratio instead of 1:16), grind slightly finer, or try brewing methods that provide more body like Aeropress or French press.

The score reflects outstanding quality with the distinctive Pink Bourbon profile clearly expressed. Points above 88 are difficult to achieve and typically require exceptional lots with perfect processing, zero defects, and extraordinary complexity or intensity.

### Comparative Cupping Context

In comparative cupping against other Colombian coffees at similar price points, this Pink Bourbon distinguishes itself through the distinctive stone fruit profile and exceptional sweetness. Generic Colombian coffees (Supremo or Excelso grades without specific origin) typically score 82-84 points and emphasize chocolate, caramel, and mild fruit notes without the complexity or distinctive character found here.

Named-region Colombians (Huila, Nariño, Tolima) from quality-focused producers typically score 85-87 points, showing more complexity and cleaner processing than generic offerings but still usually expressing more traditional Colombian profiles (chocolate, nuts, mild fruit, clean acidity) rather than the distinctive variety character of this Pink Bourbon.

Other Pink Bourbon lots provide interesting comparison points. The variety's distinctive profile is consistent across origins, but terroir and processing create variations. Pink Bourbons from other Colombian regions show similar stone fruit character but may emphasize different notes—more tropical fruit from warmer regions, more floral notes from areas with different soil composition. The Huila terroir in this coffee contributes particularly clean acidity and clarity that allows the variety characteristics to express brilliantly.

### Personal Assessment and Tasting Notes

My personal evaluation across multiple brewing methods and cups confirms a coffee that's immediately impressive and rewards deeper exploration. The first cup announces the Pink Bourbon character clearly with bold peach and brown sugar notes that create instant appeal. This immediate accessibility is valuable—the coffee doesn't require acquired taste or expertise to appreciate, making it excellent for sharing with guests or introducing someone to specialty coffee.

Subsequent cups reveal the underlying complexity that makes this coffee interesting beyond just pleasant. The layers of stone fruit (peach, apricot, nectarine, subtle plum), the delicate florals that weave through the fruit, the nuanced acidity structure, and the long sweet finish all reward careful attention. The coffee has enough depth that it remains interesting through an entire bag rather than becoming monotonous.

The versatility across brewing methods is notable and valuable for home brewing. Many specialty coffees excel in one preparation (often pour-over) but disappoint in others. This Pink Bourbon delivers excellent results in pour-over, espresso, Aeropress, and even French press—each method emphasizes different characteristics but all produce enjoyable, balanced cups. This versatility makes a single bag more valuable as it enables experimentation and variety.

The cleanliness and lack of defects is appreciated across all cups. There are no fermentation funks, no papery notes, no astringency or harsh flavors, no batch-to-batch variation. Every cup has been consistently excellent, reflecting quality control at all stages from cultivation through roasting.

### Value Assessment

At $22 for 340 grams, this coffee costs approximately $64.71/kg or $29.35/lb. This is premium pricing but reasonable for the quality and variety. Pink Bourbon's rarity and distinctive cup profile justify a premium over generic Colombian coffee ($16-20/lb) or even standard named-origin Colombians ($20-25/lb).

Compared to other rare variety offerings—[[Coffee Varieties/Geisha]] typically $40-100/lb, [[Coffee Varieties/Eugenioides]] $50-80/lb, experimental processing $35-60/lb—this Pink Bourbon offers exceptional value. It delivers distinctive, recognizable variety character comparable to Geisha at roughly one-third the price.

The cost per cup (approximately $1.29 at 20g per cup) is excellent value compared to cafe pricing ($4-7 for similar quality) and reasonable compared to other premium home brewing options. The quality and enjoyment per dollar is high.
