# 🫘 Colombia Supremo

**Origin**: Colombia  
**Grade**: Supremo (Screen Size 17+)  
**Processing**: Washed (Wet Processing)  
**Typical Altitude**: 1,400-2,000 MASL  
**Primary Varieties**: Caturra, Castillo, Colombia

## 📋 Overview

Colombia Supremo represents the highest grade of Colombian coffee based on bean size, with beans that pass through a screen size 17 or larger (approximately 6.75mm). This classification system is unique to Colombia and reflects not just size, but often correlates with quality, as larger beans typically come from higher altitudes and more mature plants.

**What Makes It Special**:
- Largest bean size classification in Colombia
- Typically from premium growing regions
- Classic Colombian flavor profile
- Consistent quality and availability
- Well-suited for various brewing methods
- Excellent introduction to specialty Colombian coffee

Colombia Supremo is the flagship coffee of one of the world's most recognized coffee-producing nations. While "Supremo" is primarily a size grading rather than quality grading, it has become synonymous with Colombian coffee excellence in international markets.

## 🌍 Origin & Geography

### Growing Regions

Colombia Supremo beans come from multiple renowned coffee-growing regions across Colombia:

**Primary Regions**:
- **Antioquia** - Western central Colombia, balanced profiles
- **Huila** - Southern Colombia, exceptional quality potential  
- **Nariño** - Southwestern highlands, complex and bright
- **Tolima** - Central mountain ranges, well-balanced
- **Cauca** - Southwestern Colombia, distinctive character
- **Santander** - Northern Colombia, traditional flavors
- **Caldas, Risaralda, Quindío** - "Coffee Triangle" (Eje Cafetero)

**Altitude Range**: 1,400-2,000 meters above sea level
- Sweet spot for Supremo: 1,600-1,900 MASL
- Higher altitudes produce denser, more flavorful beans
- Mountain slopes provide ideal drainage and temperature variation

**Climate Characteristics**:
- Temperature: 17-23°C (63-73°F) average
- Rainfall: 1,800-2,800mm annually, distributed throughout year
- Two harvest seasons in many regions (main and mitaca)
- Volcanic soil rich in minerals and nutrients
- Cloud cover moderates temperature extremes
- Year-round production due to equatorial location

## 🔬 Bean Characteristics

### Size Grading System

Colombian coffee uses a precise screen size grading system:

**Size Classifications**:
- **Supremo**: Screen size 17+ (≥6.75mm diameter) - Largest
- **Excelso**: Screen size 14-16 (5.5-6.75mm) - Standard export grade
- **UGQ** (Usual Good Quality): Mixed sizes, lower grade
- **Caracol** (Peaberry): Round beans, separate classification

**Physical Characteristics**:
- Large, uniform beans
- Blue-green color when unroasted
- Oval shape, distinct center cut
- Dense structure from high-altitude growing
- Clean, minimal defects
- Consistent size within lot

**Why Size Matters**:
- Larger beans often from older, established trees
- Better heat distribution during roasting
- Generally associated with higher altitudes
- Easier to roast evenly
- More developed flavor potential
- Premium pricing in commodity market

### Quality Indicators

**Premium Supremo Traits**:
- Uniformity of bean size (minimal variation)
- Absence of defects (quakers, insect damage, broken beans)
- Vibrant blue-green color (fresh green coffee)
- Sweet, clean aroma from green beans
- High density (sinks in water, doesn't float)
- Moisture content 10-12% (ideal for storage)

## 🌱 Varieties & Genetics

### Common Varieties in Supremo Coffee

**Caturra** (40-50% of production):
- Bourbon mutation discovered in Brazil, thriving in Colombia
- Compact plant, higher yield than traditional Typica
- Excellent cup quality when grown at altitude
- Sweet, balanced, classic Colombian profile
- Medium-high acidity, good body
- Susceptible to coffee leaf rust (requires care)

**Castillo** (30-40% of production):
- Colombian-developed hybrid (Caturra x Timor Hybrid)
- Created for leaf rust resistance
- Released by Cenicafé (Colombian Coffee Research)
- Good cup quality with disease resistance
- Slightly less complex than pure Caturra
- Becoming dominant due to climate pressures

**Colombia Variety** (10-20% of production):
- Earlier rust-resistant hybrid
- Predecessor to Castillo
- Good quality, reliable production
- Regional variations in flavor

**Less Common**:
- **Typica**: Original variety, declining due to low yield
- **Bourbon**: Present in some heritage farms
- **Gesha/Geisha**: Experimental micro-lots
- **F1 Hybrids**: Emerging in progressive farms

## 🔄 Processing Method

### Colombian Washed Processing

Colombia is famous for wet processing (washed method), which defines the classic Colombian flavor profile:

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Selective Picking** (October-February main harvest, April-June mitaca)
   - Only ripe red cherries picked
   - Multiple passes through farm
   - Hand-picking on mountain slopes

2. **Pulping** (Within 6-12 hours of picking)
   - Mechanical removal of skin and most fruit
   - Disc pulpers common on Colombian farms
   - Mucilage remains on parchment

3. **Fermentation** (12-24 hours)
   - Tanks or fermentation channels
   - Natural enzymes break down mucilage
   - Water may be added (Colombian-style fermentation)
   - Temperature and altitude affect fermentation time
   - Monitored by touch/feel for mucilage removal

4. **Washing** (Thorough rinsing)
   - Channels or washing tanks
   - Running water removes fermented mucilage
   - Clean parchment coffee remains
   - Density separation (floaters removed)

5. **Drying** (10-15 days depending on method)
   - **Mechanical Dryers** (guardiolas): Common due to humidity
   - **Parabolic Dryers**: Solar-powered, increasingly used
   - **Raised Beds**: Some specialty producers
   - **Patio Drying**: Traditional but weather-dependent
   - Target: 10-12% moisture content

6. **Dry Milling**
   - Parchment removed (hulling)
   - Sorting by size (screen sizing for Supremo grade)
   - Density sorting
   - Color sorting (modern mills)
   - Hand-sorting for defects
   - Grading and classification

**Why Washed Processing?**:
- Colombia's humid climate makes natural processing challenging
- Washed method produces clean, bright, consistent flavors
- Highlights terroir and bean characteristics
- Reduces defects and fermentation issues
- International market preference for Colombian washed

**Flavor Impact**:
- Clean, bright acidity
- Clear flavor notes
- Balanced sweetness
- Medium to full body
- Less fruit-forward than natural process
- Classic, approachable profile
