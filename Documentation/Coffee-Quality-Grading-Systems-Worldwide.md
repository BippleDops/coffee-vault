# 📊 Coffee Quality Grading Systems

**Category**: Quality Standards  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee grading systems classify quality using different criteria globally - altitude (Guatemala SHB), size (Colombia Supremo/Excelso, Kenya AA/AB), defects (Specialty Grade), or cupping scores - creating complex landscape where understanding each system enables informed purchasing and quality assessment.

**Grading Criteria Vary**:
1. **Altitude**: Guatemala (SHB, HB, etc.)
2. **Bean Size**: Colombia (Supremo/Excelso), Kenya (AA/AB/C)
3. **Defect Count**: SCAA Specialty Grade (<5 defects per 300g)
4. **Cupping Score**: 80+ points = specialty grade
5. **Mixed**: Ethiopia (Grades 1-5, mix of defects and size)

**Key Insight**: **Size ≠ Quality** (larger beans don't automatically taste better)

## 🇬🇹 Guatemala - Altitude Grading

**System**: Based on growing altitude (MASL)

1. **SHB** (Strictly Hard Bean): 1,350+ MASL - **Highest Quality**
2. **HB** (Hard Bean): 1,200-1,350 MASL
3. **SH** (Semi-Hard Bean): 1,050-1,200 MASL
4. **EPW** (Extra Prime Washed): 900-1,050 MASL
5. **PW** (Prime Washed): 750-900 MASL
6. **EGW** (Extra Good Washed): 600-750 MASL
7. **GW** (Good Washed): Below 600 MASL

**Logic**: Higher altitude = slower maturation = denser beans = better quality

---

## 🇨🇴 Colombia - Size Grading

**System**: Based on screen size (bean size)

- **Supremo**: Screen 17+ (≥6.75mm) - Largest beans
- **Excelso**: Screen 14-16 (5.5-6.75mm) - Standard export
- **UGQ**: Mixed smaller sizes

**Reality**: Size doesn't determine cup quality (Excelso often equals/exceeds Supremo quality)

---

## 🇰🇪 Kenya - Size + Density

**Size Classifications**:
- **AA**: Screen 17-18 (largest)
- **AB**: Screen 15-16 (most common, often best value)
- **C**: Below screen 15 (smaller)
- **E** (Elephant): Very large beans
- **PB** (Peaberry): Round beans (separate classification)
- **TT, T**: Smaller grades

**Plus**: Grade 1 or 2 (defect grading)

**Best**: AA Grade 1 = largest + cleanest (but AB Grade 1 often equal quality, better value)

---

## 🇪🇹 Ethiopia - Defect/Physical Grading

**Grades 1-5** (Mix of defects and physical characteristics):
- **Grade 1**: 0-3 defects per 300g (best, specialty)
- **Grade 2**: 4-12 defects (very good, specialty)
- **Grade 3**: 13-25 defects (good, commercial)
- **Grade 4**: 26-45 defects (lower, commercial)
- **Grade 5**: 46+ defects (commodity)

**Specialty**: Grade 1-2 required

---

## ☕ SCAA/SCA Specialty Grade

**Universal Standard**:
- **<5 Defects**: Per 300g green sample
- **0 Primary Defects**: No black beans, severe issues
- **80+ Cup Score**: Cupping score 80+ points
- **Moisture**: 10-12% moisture content
- **Uniformity**: Size and color uniformity

**Specialty**: Must meet ALL criteria

## 📝 Summary

Coffee grading varies globally - altitude (Guatemala SHB), size (Colombia Supremo, Kenya AA), defects (Ethiopia Grade 1, SCAA <5 defects), and cupping scores (80+ specialty) create complex systems. Understanding that size doesn't equal quality (Guatemala SHB altitude matters more than bean size, Kenya AB often equals AA) enables informed purchasing beyond grade marketing.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Guatemala**: Altitude-based (SHB = best, 1,350+ MASL)
- **Colombia**: Size-based (Supremo largest, but Excelso quality equal)
- **Kenya**: Size + defects (AA largest, AB often best value)
- **Ethiopia**: Defect count (Grade 1-2 specialty)
- **Universal**: SCAA Specialty = <5 defects + 80+ cupping score
- **Reality**: Size ≠ quality automatically
