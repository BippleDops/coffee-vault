## 📋 Overview

Starting a coffee shop requires $200,000-500,000 investment (location, equipment, buildout, inventory, working capital) with 18-36 months to profitability through espresso drinks, retail coffee sales, and food offerings creating community gathering spaces.

**Business Models**:
1. **Espresso Bar**: Focus on drinks, minimal food (lower overhead)
2. **Full Café**: Drinks + substantial food menu (higher revenue, more complex)
3. **Roaster-Café**: Roast on-site + café (vertical integration, high investment)
4. **Drive-Through**: Convenience focus (different market)

**Initial Investment** ($200,000-500,000):
- **Location**: Lease, buildout, permits ($50,000-200,000)
- **Equipment**: Espresso machine, grinders, brewers ($40,000-100,000)
- **Furniture**: Tables, chairs, décor ($20,000-50,000)
