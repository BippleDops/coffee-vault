## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Maximum Efficiency:

1. **Use Parallel Agents**: Launch multiple agents for independent tasks
   - Agent 1: Citations (Category A)
   - Agent 2: Citations (Category B)
   - Agent 3: Visualizations
   - Agent 4: Link repair
   - Agent 5: QA/Integration

2. **Batch Similar Work**: Complete all of one category before moving to next
   - All citations for Brewing Science → then Sensory Science → then Equipment

3. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each deliverable works before moving on
   - Run `npm run ci` after link repairs
   - Test visualizations in browser after updating
   - Verify achievement detection with sample data

4. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of what's been done
   - Update status reports
   - Note any deviations from plan
   - Track time spent (for future estimation)

5. **Commit Frequently**: Commit after each major deliverable
   - "Add citations to 10 Brewing Science references"
   - "Update 8 visualizations with v7.0 infrastructure"
   - "Implement achievement detection system"
