# 💰 Processing Economics & Cost Analysis

**Category**: Business & Economics  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Processing method economics affect farmer income and coffee pricing - washed processing costs more (water, labor, infrastructure) but creates clean profiles; honey/natural cost less but require technique; experimental (anaerobic) costs most but commands ultra-premiums.

**Processing Costs** (Per kg parchment):

**Washed**:
- **Labor**: $0.20-0.40/kg (depulping, fermentation, washing)
- **Water**: $0.05-0.15/kg (50-150 liters)
- **Infrastructure**: Wet mill, fermentation tanks ($10,000-50,000 initial)
- **Total Variable**: $0.25-0.55/kg
- **Premium**: $0.30-1.00/kg above natural (clean cup value)

**Honey**:
- **Labor**: $0.30-0.60/kg (constant raking, monitoring)
- **Water**: Minimal (depulping only)
- **Infrastructure**: Raised beds essential ($5,000-20,000)
- **Total**: $0.30-0.60/kg
- **Premium**: $0.50-2.00/kg above washed (sweetness, uniqueness)

**Natural**:
- **Labor**: $0.15-0.30/kg (turning, monitoring)
- **Water**: Zero
- **Infrastructure**: Patios or beds ($2,000-15,000)
- **Total**: $0.15-0.30/kg (cheapest)
- **Premium**: $0.30-1.50/kg (when quality, fruit-forward)

**Anaerobic/Experimental**:
- **Labor**: $0.50-1.50/kg (intensive monitoring)
- **Infrastructure**: Sealed tanks, equipment ($5,000-30,000)
- **Risk**: High failure rate (lost lots)
- **Total**: $1.00-2.00/kg
- **Premium**: $3.00-15.00+/kg (ultra-specialty, when successful)

## 💡 Farmer Decision

**Washed**: Safe, clean, reliable market (but water/cost)  
**Honey**: Higher premium, labor-intensive (worth it if market access)  
**Natural**: Lowest cost, but quality risk (weather-dependent)  
**Experimental**: High risk, high reward (requires specialty buyers)

## 📝 Summary

Processing economics vary dramatically - washed costs most ($0.25-0.55/kg) through water and labor but creates clean reliable profiles; honey ($0.30-0.60/kg) is labor-intensive but commands premiums; natural cheapest ($0.15-0.30/kg) but weather-dependent; experimental most expensive ($1-2/kg) but ultra-premiums ($3-15+/kg) justify when successful.
