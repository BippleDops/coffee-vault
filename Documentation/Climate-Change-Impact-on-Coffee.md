# 🌡️ Climate Change Impact on Coffee

**Category**: Coffee & Sustainability  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Climate change threatens coffee production through rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and increased pest/disease pressure - with projections suggesting 50% of current coffee lands unsuitable by 2050, forcing adaptation through altitude migration, variety development, and agroforestry systems.

**Primary Threats**:
1. **Rising Temperatures**: Optimal range 15-24°C narrowing, forcing altitude migration
2. **Rainfall Changes**: Unpredictable patterns, droughts, extreme rain
3. **Pest/Disease**: Warmer temps expand coffee rust, berry borer ranges
4. **Altitude Squeeze**: Coffee pushed higher, eventually runs out of mountain

**Projected Impact**:
- **2050**: 50% of current coffee lands unsuitable (temperature rise)
- **Quality Origins**: Ethiopia, Colombia, Central America most threatened
- **Farmer Livelihoods**: Millions affected, migration pressures
- **Price**: Scarcity drives prices higher
- **Species**: Arabica more vulnerable than Robusta

## 🌍 Regional Impacts

**Ethiopia** (Coffee's Birthplace):
- **70-80% loss** of suitable land projected by 2100
- Wild forests threatened (genetic diversity at risk)
- Traditional regions becoming too warm

**Central America** (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua):
- Altitude migration (farms move higher)
- Eventually run out of mountain (altitude ceiling)
- Increased rust pressure (warmer, wetter)

**Colombia**:
- Higher altitudes still available (Andes mountains)
- But increased weather volatility
- Rust epidemics more frequent

**Brazil**:
- Some regions becoming too hot
- Drought pressures increasing
- Frost risk patterns changing

## 🛡️ Adaptation Strategies

**Altitude Migration**:
- **Move Higher**: Plant at higher elevations (cooler)
- **Limitation**: Eventually run out of mountain
- **Conflict**: Forest clearing for new coffee lands

**Resistant Varieties**:
- **F1 Hybrids**: Climate-resilient, heat-tolerant
- **Robusta Hybrids**: Arabica quality + Robusta heat tolerance
- **Selection**: Breeding for climate adaptation

**Agroforestry**:
- **Shade Systems**: Trees moderate temperature extremes
- **Resilience**: Diversified systems more climate-resilient
- **Carbon**: Trees sequester carbon, mitigate impact

**Irrigation**:
- **Drought Adaptation**: Where water available
- **Cost**: Infrastructure investment required
- **Sustainability**: Water scarcity concerns

## 🔬 Research and Innovation

**Variety Development**:
- **Heat-Tolerant**: Breeding varieties for warmer conditions
- **Drought-Resistant**: Water-efficient varieties
- **F1 Hybrids**: Climate adaptation + quality

**Processing Innovation**:
- **Water Conservation**: Eco-pulpers, honey processing
- **Efficiency**: Resource-efficient processing

**Technology**:
- **Precision Agriculture**: Data-driven farming
- **Early Warning**: Pest/disease prediction systems

## 📝 Summary

Climate change threatens 50% of coffee lands by 2050 through rising temperatures (optimal 15-24°C range shifting), rainfall changes, and increased pest/disease pressure - requiring adaptation through altitude migration (limited by mountains), climate-resilient varieties (F1 Hybrids), and agroforestry systems (shade moderation) to ensure coffee's sustainable future.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Threat**: 50% of lands unsuitable by 2050
- **Temperature**: Rising temps push coffee higher (altitude squeeze)
- **Pests**: Rust, borer expanding ranges
- **Adaptation**: Altitude migration, resistant varieties, agroforestry
- **Urgency**: Industry transformation essential
