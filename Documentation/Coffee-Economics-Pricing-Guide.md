# 💰 Coffee Economics and Pricing

**Category**: Coffee Business & Economics  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee economics spans commodity futures trading to ultra-premium specialty auctions - with C-Market commodity prices ($1-2/lb) at bottom and Panama Geisha auctions ($1,000/lb) at top, creating complex value chain where farmers receive 10-50% of retail price depending on market position.

**Price Tiers**:
- **Commodity**: $1-2/lb green (C-Market)
- **Commercial**: $2-4/lb (above commodity)
- **Specialty**: $4-12/lb (quality premium)
- **Ultra-Premium**: $12-100+/lb (Geisha, competition, rare)

---

## 📊 C-Market (Commodity)

**What is C-Market**:
- **Futures Market**: ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) coffee futures
- **Commodity Pricing**: Base price for commercial Arabica
- **Volatile**: Fluctuates daily based on supply/demand
- **Floor**: Often below production cost (farmer crisis)

**Problems**:
- Farmers receive commodity price regardless of quality
- Volatile, unpredictable
- Often below cost of production
- No quality differentiation

## 💎 Specialty Premiums

**Quality Premiums**:
- **Good**: +$1-2/lb above C-Market
- **Excellent**: +$3-6/lb
- **Exceptional**: +$6-15/lb
- **Competition**: +$10-100+/lb

**Why Premiums**:
- Quality (cupping scores)
- Processing (honey, natural, experimental)
- Variety (Geisha, Pacamara, heirloom)
- Origin (reputation, terroir)
- Certifications (organic, fair trade)
- Rarity (limited production)

## 🔗 Value Chain

**Farmgate → Retail** (Typical Specialty):
- **Farmer**: $4-6/lb (40-50% of retail)
- **Exporter**: +$0.50-1/lb
- **Importer**: +$0.50-1/lb
- **Roaster**: +$4-8/lb (roasting, overhead, profit)
- **Retail**: $15-25/12oz (~$20-33/lb)

**Direct Trade** (Better for Farmers):
- **Farmer**: $6-12/lb (50-70% of retail)
- **Roaster**: Buys directly (no middlemen)
- **Retail**: $18-30/12oz
- **Result**: Farmer gets higher %, customer pays similar

## 📝 Summary

Coffee pricing ranges from commodity C-Market ($1-2/lb) to ultra-premium specialty ($100+/lb) with value chain distributing retail price among farmers (10-50%), exporters, importers, and roasters. Direct Trade and specialty premiums improve farmer income while quality differentiation enables sustainable pricing above commodity levels.
