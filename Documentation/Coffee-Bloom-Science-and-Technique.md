# 💨 Coffee Bloom - Complete Guide

**Category**: Advanced Brewing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee blooming (initial saturation releasing CO₂) is critical for even extraction - with fresh coffee (7-21 days) producing vigorous bloom indicating quality and degassing essential for preventing channeling and uneven extraction.

**What is Bloom**:
- **CO₂ Release**: Trapped CO₂ from roasting escapes
- **Visual**: Grounds bubble, dome, expand dramatically
- **Duration**: 30-45 seconds before main pour
- **Fresh Indicator**: Vigorous bloom = fresh coffee (7-21 days off roast)
- **Purpose**: Degassing prevents channeling, enables even saturation

**Why Essential**:
- **Even Extraction**: CO₂ removed prevents dry pockets, channeling
- **Fresh Coffee**: Especially critical for fresh beans (high CO₂)
- **Quality**: Proper bloom dramatically improves cup quality

## 🎯 Optimal Bloom Technique

**Amount**: 2-2.5x coffee weight (20g coffee = 40-50g water)  
**Pour**: Gentle spiral, saturate all grounds evenly  
**Time**: 30-45 seconds (fresh coffee may need 45-60s)  
**Observation**: Should bubble actively, dome up  
**Swirl** (Optional): Gentle swirl ensures complete saturation

## 📊 Bloom as Freshness Indicator

**Vigorous Bloom** (Fresh, 7-14 days):
- Dramatic doming, active bubbling
- High CO₂ content
- Peak freshness

**Moderate Bloom** (14-21 days):
- Healthy bubbling, some doming
- Good freshness

**Flat Bloom** (30+ days):
- Minimal bubbling, no dome
- Stale coffee indicator
- Still brew but expect less quality

## 📝 Summary

Blooming (30-45 second initial saturation with 2-2.5x water) releases CO₂ from fresh coffee preventing channeling and enabling even extraction - vigorous bloom indicates freshness (7-21 days), flat bloom suggests stale coffee (30+ days). Proper blooming dramatically improves extraction quality.
