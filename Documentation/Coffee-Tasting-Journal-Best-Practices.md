## 🎯 Tasting Process

**Systematic Approach**:
1. **Smell Dry Grounds**: Note aroma before brewing

4. **Taste Hot** (160-170°F): First impressions
5. **Taste Warm** (140-150°F): Sweetness peak, complexity
6. **Taste Cool** (120-130°F): Acidity clarity, fruit notes
7. **Taste Room Temp**: Final assessment, defects reveal

**Record at Each Temperature**: Coffee evolves dramatically as cools
