### Reddit Post (r/Coffee, r/espresso)

**Title**:
🚀 I spent [X months] building Coffee Vault 1000: A free, AI-powered coffee knowledge system with 1,000 interconnected notes and a graph database. Here's what I learned.

**Body**:
Hey r/Coffee,

After [X months] of work, I'm excited to share Coffee Vault 1000—a comprehensive coffee knowledge system that's completely free and open-source.

**What is it?**

Think of it as a combination of:
- Wikipedia's comprehensiveness
- A graph database's connections
- ChatGPT's AI search
- Professional tools for brewing

All focused on coffee, with scientific rigor and zero paywalls.

**What's inside?**

- 1,000 meticulously researched notes
- 180+ scientific references (all cited properly)
- 59 origin profiles with flavor data
- Advanced brewing calculator with 3D visualization
- AI integration (works with Claude, ChatGPT, or local models via Ollama)
- Knowledge graph with 50,000+ relationships

**Cool features:**

1. **Ask questions naturally**: "What's the best grind size for light roast Ethiopian coffee in a V60?" Get instant, cited answers.

2. **Discover connections**: The graph database reveals relationships you'd never find manually. "Show me all origins with similar flavor profiles to Yirgacheffe."

3. **Track your journey**: Achievement system, progress dashboard, and brewing logs with extraction analysis.

4. **Professional tools**: Recipe costing calculator, inventory management, competition prep resources.

**Why free?**

Because coffee knowledge should be accessible to everyone. I'm tired of:
- $40 paywalls for scientific papers
- Contradictory advice from uncited sources
- "Guides" that are really just ads
- Gatekeeping of expertise

So everything is Creative Commons licensed, with an open API and full documentation.

**How to use it:**

- **Digital garden**: coffeeknowledge.garden (just browse)
- **With AI**: Install MCP server, chat with your notes
- **Graph exploration**: Query Neo4j database
- **API access**: Build your own tools

**Tech stack** (for the nerds):

- Obsidian (knowledge base)
- Neo4j (graph database)
- MCP (AI integration)
- Quartz (digital garden)
- Chart.js + Plotly (visualizations)

**What's next:**

- Community contributions (open PR process)
- More languages (starting with Spanish, Italian)
- Mobile app
- Academic partnerships

**Questions I expect:**

*Q: Is this better than [existing resource]?*
A: It's different. We focus on connections and scientific rigor. Plus, it's free and you can use it offline.

*Q: How accurate is the information?*
A: Every scientific claim has 2+ citations. Community peer review process for new additions.

*Q: Can I contribute?*
A: Yes! GitHub repo is open. Contribution guidelines are in the docs.

*Q: How do you make money?*
A: I don't. This is a passion project for the community.
