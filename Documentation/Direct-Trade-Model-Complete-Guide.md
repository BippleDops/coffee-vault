**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Direct Trade bypasses traditional supply chain (farmer → exporter → importer → roaster) creating direct relationships between farmers and roasters - enabling better farmer prices (50-70% of retail vs. 10-30% commodity), quality feedback, transparency, and multi-year partnerships benefiting both parties.

**What is Direct Trade**:
- **Direct Relationships**: Roaster buys directly from farmer/cooperative
- **No Middlemen**: Bypasses exporters, importers (or minimal involvement)
- **Farm Visits**: Roasters visit farms, build personal relationships
- **Quality Focus**: Quality-based pricing, feedback loops
- **Multi-Year**: Long-term commitments enable farm investment
- **Transparency**: Full supply chain disclosure

**Pioneers**:
- **Intelligentsia**: Coined "Direct Trade," pioneered model (early 2000s)
- **Counter Culture**: "Direct Trade" parallel development
- **Sustainable Harvest**: "Relationship Coffee" (similar concept, 1990s)
