# 📦 Coffee Storage & Freshness Guide

**Category**: Coffee Care & Preservation  
**Difficulty**: Beginner

---

## 📋 Overview

Proper coffee storage preserves quality for 2-4 weeks post-roast - with airtight containers, cool temperatures, and darkness preventing oxidation, moisture absorption, and aromatic loss that cause staling.

**Coffee Freshness Timeline**:
- **0-3 days**: Too fresh, excessive CO₂, needs degassing
- **4-14 days**: PEAK freshness, optimal flavor
- **14-28 days**: Good, gradual decline
- **28-45 days**: Acceptable, noticeable degradation
- **45+ days**: Stale, significant quality loss

**Storage Enemies**:
1. **Oxygen**: Oxidation (staling, rancidity)
2. **Moisture**: Absorbs humidity (flavor loss)
3. **Heat**: Accelerates degradation
4. **Light**: Degrades compounds
5. **Time**: Natural aging process

## ✅ Optimal Storage

**Container**:
- **Airtight**: Prevents oxygen exposure
- **Opaque**: Blocks light
- **Valve**: One-way valve ideal (releases CO₂, prevents oxygen entry)
- **Size**: Match container to coffee amount (minimize air space)

**Location**:
- **Cool**: 60-70°F (15-21°C), not refrigerator/freezer
- **Dark**: Cupboard, pantry (not countertop)
- **Dry**: Low humidity environment

**Form**:
- **Whole Bean**: Stays fresh longer (surface area minimal)
- **Ground**: Stales rapidly (large surface area) - grind immediately before brewing

---

## ❌ Storage Mistakes

**Refrigerator/Freezer**:
- **Moisture**: Condensation when removed (ruins coffee)
- **Odors**: Absorbs food odors
- **Exception**: Long-term freezer storage (months), vacuum-sealed, frozen continuously
- **General**: Don't refrigerate/freeze for daily use

**Clear Containers**:
- **Light Exposure**: Degrades quality
- **Use**: Opaque containers only

**Buying Pre-Ground**:
- **Rapid Staling**: Pre-ground stales in days (not weeks)
- **Always**: Grind fresh immediately before brewing

---

## 📅 Buying Strategy

**Buy Fresh**:
- **Roast Date**: Check roast date (buy within 2-3 weeks of roasting)
- **Quantity**: Buy 1-2 weeks supply only (finish within peak freshness)
- **Frequency**: Order/buy every 1-2 weeks (maintain freshness)

**Avoid**:
- **No Roast Date**: Unknown freshness (could be months old)
- **Large Quantities**: Can't consume within 2-4 weeks = waste
- **Pre-Ground**: Unless using same day

---

## 🔬 Staling Science

**What Happens**:
- **Oxidation**: Volatile aromatics react with oxygen → stale compounds
- **CO₂ Loss**: Degassing continues, aroma escapes
- **Moisture**: Absorbs humidity, becomes flat
- **Time**: Chemical degradation continues

**Result**:
- **Aroma**: Fades dramatically (volatile loss)
- **Flavor**: Flat, dull, cardboard notes emerge
- **Crema**: Less crema (espresso), lighter color
- **Bloom**: Minimal bloom (pour-over indicator of staleness)

## 📝 Summary

Coffee freshness peaks 4-14 days post-roast, remains good 14-28 days, becomes stale 28+ days - preserved through airtight, opaque containers in cool, dark locations. Buy 1-2 weeks supply only, always whole bean (grind fresh), and avoid refrigeration (moisture condensation). Roast date checking essential for quality.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Peak**: 4-14 days post-roast
- **Good**: 14-28 days
- **Stale**: 28+ days
- **Storage**: Airtight, cool, dark, dry
- **Form**: Whole bean only (grind fresh)
- **Quantity**: Buy 1-2 weeks supply
