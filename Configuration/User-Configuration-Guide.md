## Part 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Templates Don't Work

**Symptoms**: Clicking template does nothing or shows raw code

**Diagnosis**:
1. Is Templater installed and enabled?
   - Settings → Community Plugins → Check "Templater"

2. Is template folder configured?
   - Settings → Templater → Template folder location
   - Should be set to "Templates"

3. Are template files in correct location?
   - File explorer → Templates folder → Should see .md files

**Solution**:
```
1. Settings → Community Plugins → Templater → Enable
2. Settings → Templater → Template folder → Set to "Templates"
3. Restart Obsidian
4. Test: Create new note, Cmd/Ctrl+T, select template
```

#### Issue: Datacore Queries Don't Display

**Symptoms**: Seeing raw query code instead of results

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if Datacore is installed:
   - Settings → Community Plugins → "Datacore"

2. Check if query syntax is correct:
   - Should start with ```datacore
   - Should end with ```

3. Check if data exists:
   - Do you have coffee logs in Coffee Logs folder?

**Solution**:
```
1. Install Datacore plugin
2. Create test coffee log
3. Verify query with simple test:
   ```datacore
   list from "Coffee Logs"
   ```
4. Should show list of log files
```

#### Issue: No Suggestions in Templates

**Symptoms**: Template creates note but all fields empty

**Diagnosis**:
1. Do you have existing coffee logs?
   - Suggestions require history to work

2. Is Datacore working?
   - Suggestions use Datacore queries

3. Are properties correct in existing logs?
   - Check frontmatter of previous logs

**Solution**:
```
1. Create 3-5 manual coffee logs first
2. Ensure each has: type, date, beans, brew-method
3. Then use template - should see suggestions
4. If still blank, check console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for errors
```

#### Issue: Obsidian Feels Slow

**Symptoms**: Lag when opening files, typing, or switching notes

**Diagnosis**:
1. How many files in vault? (Settings → About)
2. How many plugins enabled?
3. Is sync running constantly?

**Solution**:
```
1. Disable unused plugins
2. Settings → Datacore → Enable caching
3. Reduce number of open panes
4. Close graph view when not using
5. Consider upgrading computer if vault is very large
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Query Optimization

**Slow queries usually have these issues**:

1. **No limits**:
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Could return thousands
const allLogs = dv.pages('"Coffee Logs"');

// ✅ GOOD - Limited scope
const recentLogs = dv.pages('"Coffee Logs"').limit(50);
```

2. **Sorting before filtering**:
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Sorts everything
dv.pages('"Coffee Logs"').sort(...).where(...)

// ✅ GOOD - Filters first
dv.pages('"Coffee Logs"').where(...).sort(...)
```

3. **Multiple queries for same data**:
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Queries 3 times
const avgV60 = dv.pages(...).where(method === "v60")...
const avgChemex = dv.pages(...).where(method === "chemex")...
const avgAero = dv.pages(...).where(method === "aeropress")...

// ✅ GOOD - Query once
const allLogs = dv.pages(...).array();
const avgV60 = allLogs.filter(l => l.method === "v60")...
const avgChemex = allLogs.filter(l => l.method === "chemex")...
```

#### Vault Organization

**Keep folders organized**:
```
Coffee Logs/          ← Daily logs only
  2025-10-25.md
  2025-10-26.md

Bean Profiles/        ← Bean documentation
  Ethiopia Yirgacheffe.md
  Colombia Huila.md

Scientific References/ ← Education content
  Extraction Science/
  Coffee Chemistry/

Analytics/            ← Dashboards
  Monthly-Dashboard.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster queries (folder-scoped)
- Easier navigation
- Better Datacore performance
- Clearer mental model

#### Sync Optimization

**If using Obsidian Sync or similar**:
1. Exclude large files from sync:
   - Settings → Sync → Excluded folders
   - Add: `.obsidian/workspace` (frequently changes)

2. Selective sync on mobile:
   - Only sync essentials
   - Exclude Visualizations/ folder

3. Reduce conflict frequency:
   - Don't edit same note on multiple devices simultaneously
   - Wait for sync to complete before switching devices
