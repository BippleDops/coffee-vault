# Pour-Over Technique Physics: Controlling Extraction Variables

## Overview

Pour-over technique transforms brewing from passive process to active craft through continuous control of water addition. Pour height, rate, pattern, and timing each influence turbulence, agitation, temperature, and flow rate—variables that directly affect extraction uniformity and flavor development.

Understanding the physics behind pouring technique reveals why seemingly minor variations (center vs. circular pour, 10cm vs. 30cm height, fast vs. slow rate) produce measurably different cups. Water introduces kinetic energy into the coffee bed, creating turbulence that enhances extraction but risks over-agitation if excessive. Mastering this balance separates competent from exceptional pour-over coffee.

This guide provides science-based frameworks for optimizing pour technique across variables: height, rate, pattern, and pulse timing, with specific applications for V60, Chemex, and other pour-over methods.

## Key Concepts

### Pour Height and Energy

**Kinetic energy from height**:
**KE = m × g × h**

Where:
- KE = kinetic energy (J)
- m = water mass (kg)
- g = gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- h = pour height (m)

**Practical example**:
100g water poured from 20cm height:
- KE = 0.1 kg × 9.8 × 0.2 = 0.196 J

From 5cm: KE = 0.049 J (75% less energy)

**Effects**:
- **High pour** (20-30cm): High turbulence, aggressive agitation
- **Low pour** (5-10cm): Gentle flow, minimal disturbance
- **Very high** (>40cm): Splashing, disrupts bed structure

### Turbulence and Mixing

**Reynolds number** (flow character):
**Re = (ρ × v × d) / μ**

**Pour-over regimes**:
- **Low height, slow pour**: Re < 2000 (laminar, minimal mixing)
- **Medium height, moderate**: Re 2000-4000 (transitional, good mixing)
- **High height, fast**: Re > 4000 (turbulent, maximum mixing)

**Effects on extraction**:
- **Turbulent flow**: Breaks up concentration boundary layer, increases extraction rate by 15-25%
- **Laminar flow**: Maintains bed structure, gentler extraction
- **Optimal**: Transitional regime (moderate turbulence, controlled extraction)

### Pour Rate and Contact Time

**Flow rate control**:
- **Fast pour** (6-8 g/s): Quickly raises water level, high pressure gradient
- **Moderate pour** (4-6 g/s): Balanced approach
- **Slow pour** (2-4 g/s): Gentle addition, extended contact time

**Bed pressure effects**:
Higher water column = higher pressure = faster flow through bed
- 10mm water height: ~100 Pa pressure
- 30mm water height: ~300 Pa pressure
- Result: 3x pressure = √3 (1.7x) faster flow rate

**Contact time impact**:
Fast pour creates higher water level, but also faster flow:
- Net effect depends on grind size and bed permeability
- Fine grind: Fast pour may slow overall brew (higher resistance)
- Coarse grind: Fast pour speeds brew (lower resistance)

## The Science

### Crust Formation and Dynamics

**What is the crust?**:
- Floating coffee particles on water surface
- Forms during bloom and initial pours
- Contains CO2-trapped particles and fines

**Crust physics**:
- **Buoyancy**: CO2 bubbles + low-density particles float
- **Surface tension**: Water surface supports fine particles
- **Insulation effect**: Crust slows heat loss (5-10°C retention)

**Breaking the crust**:
- **Aggressive pour**: Breaks crust, sinks particles, increases agitation
- **Gentle pour**: Maintains crust, less agitation
- **Stirring**: Intentionally breaks crust (competition technique)

**When to break**:
- **Fresh coffee** (<7 days): Break crust at 45-60s to release CO2
- **Optimal coffee** (7-21 days): Natural breakdown during pour
- **Aged coffee** (>21 days): Minimal crust formation

### Water Distribution Patterns

**Pour patterns**:

**Center pour**:
- Water lands in center, flows radially outward
- Creates conical bed (deeper in center)
- Faster flow (cone geometry drains quickly)
- Risk: Center over-extraction, edge under-extraction

**Spiral/Circular pour**:
- Water distributed across surface
- More even saturation
- Maintains flatter bed
- Balanced extraction top-to-bottom

**Perimeter pour**:
- Avoids center (reduces fines migration)
- Even edge saturation
- Competition technique (precision required)

**Optimal pattern**: Depends on brewer geometry
- **V60** (cone): Center or gentle spiral
- **Kalita** (flat bed): Circular for even coverage
- **Chemex**: Center pour (thick filter slows edge flow)

### Agitation and Extraction Rate

**How agitation increases extraction**:
1. **Boundary layer disruption**: Removes saturated water layer around particles
2. **Convective transport**: Replaces with fresh solvent
3. **Particle rotation**: Exposes un-extracted surfaces
4. **Fines migration**: Moves small particles (can clog filter)

**Quantified impact**:
Studies show controlled agitation increases extraction rate by 12-18% compared to static percolation.

**Over-agitation risks**:
- Excessive fines migration (slower drawdown)
- Bed compaction (channeling)
- Uncontrolled turbulence (uneven extraction)
- Bitterness (over-extraction of surface compounds)

**Optimal agitation**:
- **Bloom**: Gentle stir or swirl (ensures complete saturation)
- **Main pour**: Moderate turbulence from pour height
- **Final**: Minimal disturbance (settle and drain)

### Temperature Management

**Heat loss factors**:
- **Ambient temperature**: Room affects brew temperature
- **Brewer thermal mass**: Cold brewer absorbs heat
- **Evaporation**: Surface cooling (5-10°C potential loss)
- **Pour rate**: Slow pour = more heat loss time

**Maintaining temperature**:
- **Preheat brewer**: Rinse with hot water (crucial for glass/ceramic)
- **Higher kettle temp**: Start 2-4°C hotter than target brew temp
- **Faster brewing**: Shorter total time = less heat loss
- **Lid/cover**: Reduces evaporative cooling (not always practical)

**Temperature profile**:
Typical 3-minute V60 brew:
- Start: 92°C (kettle temp after bloom)
- 1:30: 89°C (mid-brew)
- 3:00: 86°C (drawdown complete)
- Average: 88-89°C effective extraction temperature

## Practical Applications

### For Home Brewers

**Optimized pour technique** (V60 example):

**Bloom pour** (0:00-0:45):
- Height: 5-10cm (very gentle)
- Rate: 2-3 g/s (slow, complete coverage)
- Pattern: Spiral from center outward
- Amount: 2-3x dose (40-60g for 20g)
- Goal: Complete saturation, minimal disruption

**First main pour** (0:45-1:15):
- Height: 10-15cm (moderate turbulence)
- Rate: 5-6 g/s (moderate)
- Pattern: Circular, cover all coffee
- Amount: To 140-160g total weight
- Goal: Establish extraction, break crust gently

**Second pour** (1:15-2:00):
- Height: 10-15cm (consistent)
- Rate: 5-6 g/s
- Pattern: Circular or center
- Amount: To 240-260g total
- Goal: Maintain flow, sustained extraction

**Third pour** (2:00-2:30):
- Height: 5-10cm (gentle)
- Rate: 4-5 g/s (slightly slower)
- Pattern: Center or gentle circular
- Amount: To final weight (320g)
- Goal: Complete brew, gentle finish

**Drawdown** (2:30-3:15):
- No pour, allow drainage
- Level bed indicates good technique
- Target completion: 2:45-3:30

**Adjusting for variables**:

**Light roast**:
- Higher pour (15-20cm) for more agitation
- Faster rate (6-7 g/s) to maintain temperature
- Break crust intentionally (60s stir)

**Dark roast**:
- Lower pour (8-12cm) for gentle extraction
- Slower rate (4-5 g/s) to prevent over-extraction
- Minimal agitation

**Fresh coffee** (<7 days):
- Very gentle bloom (avoid splashing)
- Lower height initially (CO2 management)
- May need extended bloom (60s)

### For Professionals

**Competition pour technique**:

**Precision pouring**:
- Weighted kettle (consistency)
- Controlled height (±2cm variation)
- Timed pours (stopwatch, each pour targeted)
- Scripted pattern (practiced 50+ times)

**Advanced techniques**:

**Rao spin**:
- After final pour, gently swirl brewer (3-5 rotations)
- Levels bed, redistributes fines
- Flattens bed for even drawdown
- Creates uniform extraction

**Center pour only**:
- All water to center (no edge contact)
- Relies on radial flow for edge saturation
- Reduces bypass/edge channeling
- Requires precise grind and distribution

**Pulse pouring** (multi-pour):
- 5-6 small pours vs. 2-3 large pours
- Maintains stable water level (10-15mm above bed)
- Prevents bed compaction
- Allows degassing between pours
- Example: 40g → 100g → 160g → 220g → 280g → 320g

**Temperature-controlled pouring**:
- Variable-temp kettle (Fellow Stagg EKG, Brewista)
- Bloom at 96°C (aggressive CO2 release)
- Main pours at 92°C (controlled extraction)
- Final pour at 88°C (prevent late over-extraction)

**Bypass water technique**:
- Intentionally pour water down sides (bypasses coffee)
- Used to dilute strong brew (turbo shot technique)
- Reduces extraction while maintaining volume
- Advanced skill (requires practice)

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Channeling/fast drawdown** (<2:00):
- Pour more gently (reduce height)
- Slow pour rate (increase contact)
- Check grind size (likely too coarse)
- Avoid edges (center pour only)

**Slow drawdown** (>4:00):
- Pour higher (reduce bed compaction)
- Faster pour rate
- Check grind size (likely too fine)
- Less agitation (fines migration)

**Uneven extraction**:
- Improve pour pattern (even coverage)
- Level bed before brewing
- Consistent pour height/rate
- Check bed flatness after drawdown

**Astringent/bitter**:
- Lower pour height (less agitation)
- Slower pour rate (reduce turbulence)
- Cooler water temperature
- Shorter total brew time

## Measurement & Testing

### Pour Consistency Testing

**Weight tracking**:
Place brewer on scale during brewing:
- Note weight at 15-second intervals
- Calculate pour rate (g/15s)
- Target: ±5g variation (good), ±2g (excellent)

**Example** (320g recipe):
- 0:00-0:45: 0→40g (bloom)
- 0:45-1:00: 40→100g (4g/s)
- 1:00-1:30: 100→180g (2.7g/s)
- 1:30-2:00: 180→260g (2.7g/s)
- 2:00-2:20: 260→320g (3g/s)

Consistency: Pour rates within 20% = good technique

### Pour Height Impact Test

**Experiment**: Same coffee, three pour heights:
1. **Low** (5cm): Gentle, minimal agitation
2. **Medium** (15cm): Standard technique
3. **High** (30cm): Aggressive agitation

**Hold constant**: Grind, water temp, total time (adjust rate)

**Measure**: TDS, EY, taste

**Expected results**:
- Low: Lower EY, fuller body, less clarity
- Medium: Balanced (target)
- High: Higher EY, brighter, more clarity (risk astringency)

### Pour Pattern Comparison

**Test patterns**:
1. **Center only**: All water to center
2. **Spiral**: Center→edge circular motion
3. **Perimeter**: Avoid center entirely

**Same coffee, same parameters**

**Expected**:
- Center: Fastest brew, cone bed, risk uneven extraction
- Spiral: Balanced, flat bed
- Perimeter: Slower, even extraction, requires skill

## Common Misconceptions

### "Pour technique doesn't affect flavor"

**Reality**: Pour height, rate, and pattern measurably affect extraction yield (15-20% variation), TDS, and flavor. Technique is one of the highest-impact variables in pour-over brewing.

### "Higher is always better"

**Reality**: Very high pours (>30cm) create excessive turbulence, disrupting bed structure and increasing risk of over-extraction and astringency. Optimal height is 10-20cm for most applications.

### "Faster pour is more efficient"

**Reality**: Fast pouring adds water quickly but may compact bed (slower overall flow). Moderate pour rates (4-6 g/s) often achieve better extraction than very fast rates (>8 g/s).

### "Pour pattern doesn't matter"

**Reality**: Center vs. spiral vs. perimeter pouring creates measurably different flow patterns, extraction uniformity, and flavor profiles. Pattern selection should match brewer geometry.

### "Once you start pouring, don't stop"

**Reality**: Pulse pouring (multiple smaller pours) can improve extraction by allowing degassing between pours and maintaining optimal water level without bed compaction.

## Summary

- **Pour height controls energy**: 20cm pour delivers 4x kinetic energy vs. 5cm, creating turbulence that increases extraction rate by 15-25%
- **Optimal height is 10-20cm**: Moderate turbulence enhances extraction without excessive agitation; <5cm too gentle, >30cm risks disruption
- **Pour rate affects pressure**: Faster pours create higher water column (higher pressure gradient) but also faster completion—balance determines total contact time
- **Pattern matters for uniformity**: Center pour creates cone bed (faster drainage); spiral pour maintains flat bed (even extraction); perimeter avoids center over-extraction
- **Agitation increases extraction**: Controlled turbulence from pouring disrupts boundary layers, accelerating extraction 12-18% vs. static flow
- **Pulse pouring prevents compaction**: Multiple small pours (40-60g each) maintain stable water level, allow degassing, prevent bed compression
- **Consistency enables control**: Tracking pour rate (±2g variation target) and maintaining height (±2cm) transforms technique from variable to reproducible skill
