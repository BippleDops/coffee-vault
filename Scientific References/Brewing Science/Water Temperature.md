# 🌡️ Water Temperature

**Category**: Brewing Science → Extraction Parameters  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Related**: [[Extraction Science]], [[Brewing Parameters]], [[Organic Acids]], [[Bitterness]]

## 📋 Overview

**Water Temperature** is one of the most influential brewing parameters, controlling extraction rate, solubility, and flavor balance. Understanding temperature effects enables precise control over [[Perceived Acidity|acidity]], [[Bitterness|bitterness]], sweetness, and overall cup quality.

**Key Insight**: Just 5°C difference dramatically changes extraction - temperature is non-negotiable for quality brewing.

## 🔬 Temperature Ranges

**Boiling (100°C)**:
- **Extraction**: Maximum solubility
- **Effect**: Extracts everything rapidly
- **Result**: Full body, high acidity, potentially harsh
- **Best for**: Light roasts, need careful control
- **Risk**: Over-extraction bitter compounds

**High (95-100°C)**:
- **Extraction**: Very high, fast
- **Effect**: Bright acidity, full extraction
- **Result**: Vibrant, complex, potentially harsh
- **Best for**: Light-medium roasts
- **Attention**: Watch for over-extraction

**Standard (92-96°C)**:
- **Extraction**: High, controlled
- **Effect**: Balanced extraction
- **Result**: Good acidity, sweetness, body
- **Best for**: Medium roasts, versatile
- **Common**: Most specialty coffee standard

**Moderate (88-92°C)**:
- **Extraction**: Moderate, gentle
- **Effect**: Smoother, less acidic
- **Result**: Round, approachable, less bright
- **Best for**: Medium-dark roasts
- **Character**: Balanced, smooth

**Low (85-88°C)**:
- **Extraction**: Low, slow
- **Effect**: Minimal acidity, gentle
- **Result**: Smooth, muted, less extraction
- **Best for**: Dark roasts, cold brew
- **Application**: Reduced bitterness

## ☕ Roast Level Match

**Light Roast** (92-96°C):
- Higher temp needed for full development
- Preserves brightness and acidity
- Avoids under-extraction sourness
- Standard: 94-96°C

**Medium Roast** (90-94°C):
- Balanced temperature
- Good sweetness and acidity
- Versatile, forgiving
- Standard: 92°C

**Medium-Dark Roast** (88-92°C):
- Lower temp to avoid harshness
- Smoother extraction
- Less bright, more body
- Standard: 90°C

**Dark Roast** (85-90°C):
- Low temp to minimize bitter compounds
- Gentle extraction
- Smooth, low acidity
- Standard: 88°C

## 🧪 Chemical Effects

**Acid Extraction**:
- Higher temp: More [[Organic Acids|organic acids]] → Brighter
- Lower temp: Fewer acids → Smoother
- [[Citric Acid|Citric]] and [[Malic Acid|malic]] extract well hot
- [[Perceived Acidity|Perceived acidity]] increases with temperature

**Bitterness Extraction**:
- Higher temp: More bitter compounds → Potentially harsh
- Lower temp: Fewer bitter → Smoother
- Phenolic compounds more soluble hot
- Risk of over-extraction at high temp

**Sweetness**:
- Moderate temp: Optimal sucrose extraction
- Too high: Bitter compounds dominate
- Too low: Insufficient sweetness extraction
- Balance: 90-94°C for most coffees

## 💡 Practical Brewing

**Pour Over (V60, Chemex, Kalita)**:
- Light roast: 94-96°C
- Medium roast: 92-94°C
- Dark roast: 88-90°C
- Pre-heat vessel critical

**Immersion (French Press, AeroPress)**:
- Slightly lower than pour over
- Longer contact compensates
- Light roast: 92-94°C
- Medium roast: 90-92°C
- Dark roast: 86-88°C

**Espresso**:
- Standard: 93-94°C (machine dependent)
- Traditional: 88-93°C
- High altitude: Adjust for boil point
- Consistent temp critical

**Cold Brew**:
- Room temp or chilled water
- 12-24 hour steep
- Different extraction profile
- Smooth, low acid

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

**Too Sour**:
- Increase temperature 2-4°C
- Check roast level (may be under-extracted)
- Verify pre-heating

**Too Bitter**:
- Decrease temperature 2-4°C
- Check roast level (may need lower temp)
- May be over-extraction

**Flat, Muddy**:
- Temperature may be too low
- Increase 2-4°C
- Check other parameters

**Inconsistent**:
- Measure actual slurry temp (not kettle temp)
- Pre-heat equipment
- Consistent heating source

## 📊 Measurement

**Kettle Temperature**:
- Starting point reference
- Drops during transfer
- Not final slurry temp
- Use as initial guide

**Slurry Temperature**:
- Actual brewing temperature
- More accurate indicator
- Typically 6-10°C below kettle
- Measure 30 seconds into brew

**Consistency**:
- Use kettle thermometer
- Record temperatures
- Track for each coffee
- Reproduce successful brews
