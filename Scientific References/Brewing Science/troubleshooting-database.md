# Coffee Brewing Troubleshooting Database

## Overview

This comprehensive troubleshooting guide provides systematic diagnosis and solutions for coffee brewing problems. Each issue is analyzed through the lens of extraction science, with step-by-step diagnostic processes and method-specific solutions.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Identify the primary symptom** (sour, bitter, weak, etc.)
2. **Review possible root causes** for that symptom
3. **Follow the diagnostic process** to isolate the specific cause
4. **Apply the recommended solution**
5. **Verify improvement** and iterate if needed

**Key Principle**: Most brewing problems stem from extraction issues - either under-extraction (< 18%), over-extraction (> 22%), or uneven extraction.

## Quick Diagnostic Flowchart

```
Is the coffee flavorful but unpleasant?
├─ Yes → Is it SOUR/SHARP? → Under-extraction (see Section 1)
│        Is it BITTER/HARSH? → Over-extraction (see Section 2)
│        Is it BOTH? → Uneven extraction (see Section 3)
│
└─ No (weak/watery) → Insufficient strength (see Section 4)

Additional issues:
- Temperature problems → See Section 5
- Texture/mouthfeel issues → See Section 6
- Channeling/flow issues → See Section 7
- Equipment-specific → See Section 8

## Section 1: Sour, Acidic, Sharp Coffee (Under-Extraction)

### Understanding Under-Extraction

**Definition**: Less than 18% of coffee mass dissolved into water. Early-extracting compounds (acids, salty notes) dominate, while later-extracting compounds (sugars, browning compounds) remain in grounds.

**Taste Characteristics**:
- Sour, tart, or vinegary
- Sharp, aggressive acidity
- Salty or grassy notes
- Thin body
- Short finish
- Lacks sweetness or complexity

### Problem 1.1: Sour Espresso Shot

**Symptoms**:
- Bright, aggressive acidity
- Sour aftertaste
- Thin crema
- Shot pulls too fast (< 20 seconds)
- Blonde/pale color throughout

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too coarse
2. Dose too low
3. Temperature too low
4. Shot time too short
5. Coffee too fresh (< 5 days off roast)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. Check shot time: Should be 25-30 seconds
2. Measure yield: Should match recipe ratio
3. Verify water temperature: Should be 90-96°C
4. Check basket dose: Should match basket size (17-20g typical)
5. Examine puck after extraction: Should be evenly saturated

**Solutions**:
- **If shot time < 25 sec**: Grind finer (1-2 clicks/notches)
- **If dose low**: Increase dose by 0.5-1g
- **If temp < 93°C**: Increase boiler temp by 1-2°C
- **If coffee very fresh**: Let rest 7-10 days or adjust recipe
- **If extraction uneven**: Improve distribution (WDT tool)

**Expected Improvement**: Balanced acidity, fuller body, sweet finish

### Problem 1.2: Sour Pour-Over (V60, Kalita, Chemex)

**Symptoms**:
- Bright but unpleasant acidity
- Lacks body and sweetness
- Brew time too fast (< 2:30 for V60)
- Water drains through very quickly
- Coffee tastes "empty"

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too coarse
2. Water temperature too low
3. Brew time too short
4. Insufficient agitation
5. Bypass (water channeling around grounds)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. Time your brew: Total time target varies by method
   - V60: 2:30-3:30
   - Kalita: 3:00-4:00
   - Chemex: 4:00-5:00
2. Observe drawdown: Should be steady, not rushing
3. Check bed after brewing: Should be flat and evenly saturated
4. Verify water temp at pour: Should be 90-96°C

**Solutions**:
- **If brew time fast**: Grind finer (2-3 clicks)
- **If temp low**: Increase kettle temp by 2-5°C
- **If bypass visible**: Pour closer to center, improve bed structure
- **If agitation low**: Stir during bloom or use more aggressive pour
- **V60 specific**: Slower, more controlled pours; try 4-5 pulses

**Advanced Fix**: Try a single-pour continuous method to maintain bed temperature

### Problem 1.3: Sour AeroPress

**Symptoms**:
- Thin, acidic cup
- Lacks sweetness
- Very quick press time
- Coffee grounds appear dry after pressing

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too coarse
2. Water temperature too low (common mistake)
3. Steep time too short
4. Insufficient agitation
5. Using inverted method with poor seal

**Solutions**:
- **Primary fix**: Grind finer, increase steep time to 1:30-2:00
- **Temperature**: Increase to 90-95°C (many use too-cool water)
- **Agitation**: Stir vigorously for 10 seconds after adding water
- **Steep time**: Extend to 2:00 before pressing
- **Press pressure**: Press slowly (30-40 seconds)

### Problem 1.4: Sour French Press

**Symptoms**:
- Sour, weak coffee despite long steep
- Grainy, unpleasant texture
- Coffee cools too much during brewing

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too coarse (yes, even for French Press)
2. Water temperature too low to start
3. Insufficient steep time (< 4 minutes)
4. Excessive heat loss during brewing
5. Stale coffee

**Solutions**:
- **Grind adjustment**: Try medium-coarse instead of coarse
- **Preheat**: Rinse French Press with hot water before brewing
- **Temperature**: Use 96°C water
- **Steep time**: Extend to 5-6 minutes
- **Insulation**: Cover with towel during steep to retain heat

### Problem 1.5: Sour Moka Pot

**Symptoms**:
- Thin, sour concentrated coffee
- Pale color
- Brews very quickly
- Little to no foam

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too coarse
2. Basket under-filled
3. Heat too high (counter-intuitive but true)
4. Gasket worn (causing pressure loss)

**Solutions**:
- **Grind**: Use fine grind (not espresso fine, but close)
- **Fill basket**: Fill completely, level off (don't tamp)
- **Heat**: Use medium-low heat for slower extraction
- **Pre-boil water**: Start with hot water in bottom chamber
- **Gasket**: Replace if worn or hard

---

## Section 2: Bitter, Harsh, Astringent Coffee (Over-Extraction)

### Understanding Over-Extraction

**Definition**: More than 22% of coffee mass dissolved into water. Late-extracting compounds (bitter alkaloids, astringent phenols) dominate flavor profile.

**Taste Characteristics**:
- Harsh bitterness (not pleasant chocolate bitterness)
- Dry, astringent mouthfeel
- Hollow or empty flavor
- Ashy or burnt notes
- Lingering bitter aftertaste

### Problem 2.1: Bitter Espresso Shot

**Symptoms**:
- Harsh, lingering bitterness
- Dark, almost black color
- Thick, dark crema
- Shot pulls slowly (> 35 seconds)
- Ashy or burnt taste

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine
2. Dose too high
3. Temperature too high
4. Excessive contact time
5. Dark roast coffee

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. Check shot time: > 35 seconds indicates over-extraction
2. Observe flow: Slow drip or very thin stream
3. Check basket: Dose should match basket (not overfilled)
4. Puck inspection: Very compact, difficult to remove
5. Temperature: May be set too high for roast level

**Solutions**:
- **If shot time > 35 sec**: Grind coarser (1-2 clicks)
- **If dose high**: Reduce by 0.5-1g
- **If temp > 94°C**: Reduce boiler temp by 1-2°C
- **Dark roast**: Use 88-92°C instead of 93-96°C
- **Channeling**: Check for uneven extraction (can cause bitter and sour)

**Expected Improvement**: Balanced flavor, pleasant sweetness, reduced bitterness

### Problem 2.2: Bitter Pour-Over

**Symptoms**:
- Overpowering bitterness
- Dry mouthfeel
- Brew time very slow (> 4:00 for V60)
- Drawdown nearly stops or stalls
- Muddy bed after brewing

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine (most common)
2. Water temperature too high
3. Excessive agitation
4. Too many fines (grinder quality issue)
5. Over-blooming

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. Time drawdown: When does bed drain?
   - V60: Should finish by 3:30
   - Kalita: Should finish by 4:00
   - Chemex: Should finish by 5:00
2. Check for clogging: Stalled drawdown indicates fine migration
3. Inspect ground coffee: Excessive powder suggests grinder issue
4. Note water temp: Should not exceed 96°C

**Solutions**:
- **If slow drawdown**: Grind coarser (3-5 clicks)
- **If fines excessive**: Sift grounds (Kruve sifter) or upgrade grinder
- **Temperature**: Reduce to 88-92°C
- **Agitation**: Reduce pour height, gentler pours
- **Bloom**: Shorter bloom time (30 sec instead of 45)
- **V60 specific**: Try 3 larger pours instead of many small pours

**Advanced Fix**: Rao Spin technique to level bed and prevent channeling

### Problem 2.3: Bitter French Press

**Symptoms**:
- Increasingly bitter over the cup
- Muddy texture
- Dry, astringent finish
- Over-extracted even at 4 minutes

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine
2. Steep time too long (> 6 minutes)
3. Water too hot (boiling)
4. Plunging too aggressively
5. Letting coffee sit on grounds after plunge

**Solutions**:
- **Grind**: Use true coarse grind (cornmeal or coarser)
- **Steep time**: Limit to 4:00-5:00 maximum
- **Temperature**: Use 92-94°C, not boiling
- **Plunge**: Press gently, stop before pressing grounds
- **Decant**: Pour immediately after plunging, don't leave in press
- **Alternative**: James Hoffmann method (skim, don't plunge, decant)

### Problem 2.4: Bitter Moka Pot

**Symptoms**:
- Extremely bitter, burnt-tasting coffee
- Gurgling, sputtering brewing
- Coffee very dark in upper chamber
- Burnt smell during brewing

**Root Causes**:
1. Heat too high (most common cause)
2. Left on heat too long
3. Bottom chamber ran dry
4. Grind too fine
5. Dark roast + standard method

**Solutions**:
- **Critical**: Remove from heat when gurgling/sputtering starts
- **Heat setting**: Use medium-low heat (slower is better)
- **Pre-boil**: Start with hot water in bottom chamber (reduces heat exposure)
- **Grind**: Use medium-fine, not too fine
- **Water level**: Don't exceed safety valve
- **Immediate serve**: Pour out as soon as brewing completes

**Why This Works**: Moka pot continues extracting as long as it's heated. Final phase extracts only bitter compounds from depleted grounds.

### Problem 2.5: Bitter Cold Brew

**Symptoms**:
- Bitter despite cold brewing
- Astringent, drying sensation
- Muddy appearance
- Fine sediment at bottom

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine
2. Steep time too long (> 24 hours)
3. Too much agitation
4. Hot water used instead of cold/room temp
5. Concentration ratio too high

**Solutions**:
- **Grind**: Use extra-coarse grind (French Press or coarser)
- **Steep time**: Limit to 16-20 hours
- **Agitation**: Stir once at beginning, then leave undisturbed
- **Temperature**: Use room temp or cold water only
- **Ratio**: Try 1:8 instead of 1:5 for concentrate
- **Filtration**: Double filter to remove all fines

## Section 3: Uneven Extraction (Both Sour and Bitter)

### Understanding Uneven Extraction

**Definition**: Different parts of the coffee bed extract at different rates, resulting in simultaneous under-extraction and over-extraction.

**Taste Characteristics**:
- Confusing flavor (both sour and bitter)
- Unpleasant complexity
- Harsh and sharp simultaneously
- Thin body despite bitter notes
- Inconsistent shots/cups

### Problem 3.1: Channeling in Espresso

**Symptoms**:
- Blonde and dark streams simultaneously
- Thin, fast-flowing channel visible
- Sour and bitter at same time
- Inconsistent shot-to-shot
- Puck shows hole or channel after extraction

**Root Causes**:
1. Poor distribution before tamping
2. Uneven tamping
3. Puck fracture during tamping
4. Worn basket or group gasket
5. Coffee too fresh (excessive CO₂)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. **Visual inspection during shot**: Watch for distinct fast/slow streams
2. **Bottomless portafilter test**: Shows channeling clearly
3. **Puck autopsy**: Remove basket, inspect for holes or uneven saturation
4. **Distribution test**: Spin basket on finger - grounds should be level

**Solutions**:
- **Distribution**: Use WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique) with thin needle tool
- **Tamping**: Ensure level tamp, consistent pressure (~30 lbs)
- **Puck prep sequence**:
  1. Dose into basket
  2. WDT (15-20 sec stirring)
  3. Level/tap to settle
  4. Tamp evenly
  5. Polish (spin tamp)
- **Equipment**: Check basket for wear, replace if old
- **Degassing**: Let coffee rest 7-14 days after roasting

**Advanced Techniques**:
- Precision baskets (VST, IMS) - more even flow
- Puck screen - prevents top channeling
- Bottomless portafilter - visual feedback

### Problem 3.2: Uneven Pour-Over Bed

**Symptoms**:
- Uneven drawdown (one side drains faster)
- Crust formation on surface
- Grounds high on one side after brewing
- Inconsistent brew times
- Mixed flavors (sour and bitter)

**Root Causes**:
1. Uneven pouring (favoring one side)
2. Cone/brewer not level
3. Paper filter stuck to wall
4. Grind distribution very uneven
5. Excessive fines clogging filter

**Solutions**:
- **Pouring technique**:
  - Pour in concentric circles from center outward
  - Maintain consistent pour height (low, ~3-4 inches)
  - Equal coverage of entire bed
- **Setup**: Ensure brewer is level (use small level if needed)
- **Filter prep**: Rinse filter thoroughly, ensure it seats evenly
- **Rao Spin**: After final pour, gently swirl brewer to level bed
- **Grind quality**: Upgrade grinder or sift out fines

**Method-Specific**:
- **V60**: Use spiral pour pattern, finish pours in center
- **Kalita**: Center-focused pours (flat bed self-levels somewhat)
- **Chemex**: Pour slowly to prevent filter collapse

### Problem 3.3: Uneven AeroPress Extraction

**Symptoms**:
- Dry grounds on top, wet on bottom after pressing
- Requires excessive pressure to press
- Short plunge time despite resistance
- Muddy, confusing flavors

**Root Causes**:
1. Inadequate stirring
2. Grind size uneven
3. Pressing too fast
4. Inverted method seal failure
5. Clogged filter

**Solutions**:
- **Stirring**: Stir vigorously 10-15 seconds after adding water
- **Second stir**: Stir again before pressing
- **Press speed**: Slow, steady pressure over 30-40 seconds
- **Filter**: Replace if using metal filter (may clog with oils)
- **Method**: Standard method more consistent than inverted for beginners

### Problem 3.4: Wide Grind Distribution

**Symptoms**:
- Problem appears across all methods
- Can't dial in coffee (always partially sour/bitter)
- Muddy, unclear flavors
- Upgrading other variables doesn't help

**Root Cause**: Poor grinder creating wide particle distribution (too many boulders and fines)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. **Visual inspection**: Ground coffee should look relatively uniform
2. **Grinder identification**:
   - Blade grinders: Always create wide distribution
   - Cheap burr grinders: Often create wide distribution
   - Misaligned burrs: Create wide distribution
3. **Sifting test**: Sift grounds - if large variance in sizes, grinder is issue

**Solutions**:
- **Short-term**:
  - Sift grounds with Kruve or similar (remove boulders and fines)
  - Use immersion methods (more forgiving)
  - Coarser grind than typical
- **Long-term**:
  - Upgrade grinder (see grinder-buying-guide.md)
  - Check burr alignment
  - Replace worn burrs

**Grinder Recommendations by Budget**:
- **Budget ($50-150)**: Baratza Encore, Timemore C2
- **Mid-range ($200-400)**: Baratza Virtuoso+, Fellow Ode
- **High-end ($500-1000)**: Baratza Forte, Niche Zero
- **Professional ($1000+)**: Mahlkonig EK43, Monolith

## Section 4: Weak, Watery, Thin Coffee (Insufficient Strength)

### Understanding Strength vs Extraction

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Strength**: Concentration (TDS%) - how much coffee is in the cup
- **Extraction**: Percentage of coffee mass dissolved (extraction yield %)

You can have:
- Weak but well-extracted (diluted good coffee)
- Strong but under-extracted (concentrated sour coffee)
- Weak and under-extracted (watery and sour)

### Problem 4.1: Weak Espresso

**Symptoms**:
- Watery texture
- Thin crema or no crema
- Pale color
- Fast shot time
- Large volume output

**Root Causes**:
1. Ratio too high (too much water for dose)
2. Grind too coarse
3. Dose too low
4. Extraction running too long (past yield target)
5. Pressure too low

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. **Measure yield**: Should be 2:1 to 2.5:1 (e.g., 18g in, 36-45g out)
2. **Check pressure gauge**: Should read 9 bar during extraction
3. **Verify dose**: Should match basket capacity (17-20g typical)
4. **Time the shot**: Include pre-infusion in total time

**Solutions**:
- **If yield too high**: Stop shot sooner (at 36-40g output for 18g dose)
- **If ratio correct but weak**: Increase dose by 1-2g, maintain same yield
- **If pressure low**: Check pump, descale machine, replace group gasket
- **Grind**: May need finer grind if flow too fast

### Problem 4.2: Weak Pour-Over

**Symptoms**:
- Watery, tea-like consistency
- Lacks flavor intensity
- Transparent appearance
- All parameters seem correct

**Root Causes**:
1. Ratio too high (too much water)
2. Dose too low
3. Beans stale
4. Light roast with medium roast recipe
5. Bypass (water not contacting grounds)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. **Verify ratio**: Should be 1:15 to 1:17 (e.g., 20g coffee to 300-340g water)
2. **Check dose**: Minimum 15g for single cup
3. **Bean age**: Roast date should be within 2-4 weeks
4. **Coverage**: Ensure all grounds contacted during bloom

**Solutions**:
- **Increase dose**: Use 20-25g instead of 15g
- **Lower ratio**: Try 1:15 instead of 1:17
- **Concentrate brew**: Make smaller volume at 1:15, dilute after if needed
- **Bean freshness**: Use fresher coffee
- **Bypass fix**: Pour directly onto grounds, avoid filter edges

### Problem 4.3: Weak French Press

**Symptoms**:
- Thin, tea-like consistency
- Lacking body despite metal filter
- Watery mouthfeel
- Insufficient flavor

**Root Causes**:
1. Ratio too high
2. Grind too coarse
3. Dose insufficient for press size
4. Water temperature too low
5. Brewing time too short

**Solutions**:
- **Ratio**: Use 1:15 instead of 1:17 (66g per liter instead of 60g)
- **Dose**: Fill to recommended level for press size
- **Grind**: Try medium-coarse instead of extra coarse
- **Temperature**: Use 94-96°C water
- **Steep time**: Extend to 5-6 minutes

### Problem 4.4: Weak AeroPress

**Symptoms**:
- Watery output
- Very pale color
- Lacks intensity
- Fast press with little resistance

**Root Causes**:
1. Ratio too high (diluting too much)
2. Dose too low
3. Water bypass (not inverted)
4. Grind too coarse
5. Press time too short

**Solutions**:
- **Dose**: Increase to 15-17g
- **Ratio**: Use 1:14 instead of 1:17
- **Inverted method**: Prevents water bypass before press
- **Grind**: Use medium-fine grind
- **Concentrate**: Brew at 1:10 ratio, dilute after if desired

## Section 5: Temperature Issues

### Problem 5.1: Coffee Cooling Too Quickly

**Symptoms**:
- Coffee tepid by time you drink it
- French Press, pour-over especially affected
- Last cup in batch much cooler

**Root Causes**:
1. Insufficient preheating
2. Thin-walled brewing vessel
3. Cold serving vessel
4. Ambient temperature too low
5. Large surface area (wide cup)

**Solutions**:
- **Preheat everything**: Brewer, server, cup
- **Boiler water**: Heat dedicated water for preheating
- **Insulation**: Cover French Press with towel during brewing
- **Server selection**: Thermal carafe instead of glass
- **Cup selection**: Thick-walled ceramic, preheated
- **Batch size**: Brew minimum amount for vessel size

### Problem 5.2: Inconsistent Water Temperature

**Symptoms**:
- Variable results day to day
- Different performance from full vs half-full kettle
- Temperature fluctuation during pour-over

**Root Causes**:
1. Kettle without temperature control
2. Variable starting temperature
3. Pouring technique affects heat loss
4. Ambient temperature variation

**Solutions**:
- **Equipment upgrade**: Electric kettle with PID (Fellow Stagg EKG, Brewista)
- **Thermometer**: Monitor with instant-read thermometer
- **Preheating**: Always start with full kettle
- **Technique**: Minimize time between reaching temp and pouring
- **Compensation**: Adjust for ambient temperature (winter vs summer)

### Problem 5.3: Espresso Temperature Surfing

**Symptoms**:
- Non-PID machine produces inconsistent shots
- First shot of day different from subsequent
- Flush timing critical but unclear

**Root Causes**:
1. Single boiler or HX machine without PID
2. Thermal oscillation in heat exchanger
3. Improper timing of cooling flush
4. Group head temperature variation

**Solutions**:
- **Warmup protocol**:
  - Heat machine 25-45 minutes before brewing
  - Pull blank shot to stabilize group
- **Temperature surfing**:
  - Single boiler: Brew during cooling phase after steam light goes off
  - HX machines: Cooling flush 2-4 seconds, then brew
- **Equipment modification**: PID installation kit
- **Upgrade path**: Dual boiler or saturated group machine

## Section 6: Texture and Mouthfeel Issues

### Problem 6.1: Lack of Body

**Symptoms**:
- Thin, watery mouthfeel
- Lacks richness
- Feels like tea more than coffee
- Disappears quickly in mouth

**Root Causes**:
1. Paper filter removing all oils
2. Light roast coffee
3. Under-extraction
4. Method not suited to coffee
5. Water too soft

**Solutions**:
- **Filter swap**: Try metal filter (AeroPress metal, French Press)
- **Method change**: French Press, Moka Pot for more body
- **Roast level**: Medium or dark roasts have more body
- **Extraction**: Ensure adequate extraction (not under)
- **Water**: Increase hardness moderately (60-80 ppm calcium)

### Problem 6.2: Excessive Sediment

**Symptoms**:
- Gritty, muddy texture
- Particles in cup (especially bottom)
- Unpleasant mouthfeel
- Particularly in French Press, AeroPress

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine for method
2. Fines passing through filter
3. Damaged or worn filter
4. Plunging/pressing too hard
5. Poor quality grinder (excessive fines)

**Solutions**:
- **Grind coarser**: Especially for French Press
- **Filter replacement**: Replace mesh filters annually
- **Gentle pressure**: Don't press last bit of liquid
- **Decanting**: Pour carefully, leave bottom bit
- **Filtration**: Additional filtering through paper after brewing
- **Grinder upgrade**: Better grinders produce fewer fines

### Problem 6.3: Flat, Lacking Texture

**Symptoms**:
- One-dimensional mouthfeel
- No complexity or layers
- Smooth but boring
- Lacks "cling" or coating sensation

**Root Causes**:
1. Over-extraction (removed pleasant oils)
2. Very hard water (suppresses flavors)
3. Stale coffee (oils oxidized)
4. Over-filtering (Chemex with worn coffee)
5. Wrong origin/roast for preference

**Solutions**:
- **Extraction**: Dial back slightly (grind coarser, lower temp)
- **Water**: Adjust to 50-100 ppm total hardness
- **Freshness**: Use coffee within 2 weeks of roasting
- **Method**: Try methods that preserve oils (French Press, metal filter)
- **Coffee selection**: Choose fuller-bodied origins (Sumatra, Brazil)

## Section 7: Channeling and Flow Issues

### Problem 7.1: Espresso Channeling (Detailed)

**Visual Indicators**:
- Blonde streams alongside dark
- Fast spurts alongside slow flow
- One side of basket flows faster
- Crema not uniform

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Bottomless portafilter**: Essential for visual diagnosis
2. **Puck examination**: Look for channels, holes, uneven saturation
3. **Timing variance**: > 5 second variation shot-to-shot indicates issue
4. **Basket inspection**: Hold to light - should have uniform holes

**Root Causes and Fixes**:

| Cause | Visual Indicator | Fix |
|-------|------------------|-----|
| Poor distribution | Puck uneven thickness | WDT (stir with needle tool) |
| Uneven tamp | Puck slanted | Level tamp, consistent pressure |
| Basket defect | Stream from specific location | Replace basket |
| Too fresh coffee | Spurting, variable flow | Rest 7-14 days |
| Puck fracture | Crack visible in puck | Don't tap after tamp |
| Group gasket worn | Side channeling | Replace gasket |
| Dose incorrect | Too much/little coffee | Measure dose precisely |

**WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique)**:
1. Dose coffee into basket
2. Use thin needle tool (0.4mm diameter needles ideal)
3. Stir in circular pattern, ensuring full depth coverage
4. Continue 15-20 seconds until uniform
5. Level by tapping or tool
6. Tamp evenly

### Problem 7.2: Pour-Over Drawdown Stall

**Symptoms**:
- Drawdown stops or becomes extremely slow
- Water pools on surface
- Brew time exceeds target by > 1 minute
- Bed appears muddy or compacted

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine (most common)
2. Excessive fines migration to filter
3. Filter clogging
4. Grind distribution too wide
5. Pour created compaction

**Solutions**:
- **Immediate**: Grind coarser next brew
- **Fines management**:
  - Sift grounds before brewing
  - Upgrade grinder
  - Use grinder with fewer fines (conical may be better than flat for this)
- **Technique**:
  - Lower pour height (reduces agitation)
  - Gentler pours
  - Rao Spin to level bed
- **Filter**: Fresh filter each time, rinse thoroughly

### Problem 7.3: Clogged AeroPress

**Symptoms**:
- Unable to press despite high pressure
- Filter bulges or ruptures
- Press plunger springs back
- Muddy coffee if successfully pressed

**Root Causes**:
1. Grind too fine
2. Excessive dose
3. Pressing too hard
4. Clogged metal filter
5. Not stirring before press

**Solutions**:
- **Grind**: Use medium-fine, not fine
- **Dose**: Max 17-18g
- **Stir**: Ensure slurry homogenized before press
- **Press technique**: Slow, steady pressure - if too much resistance, stop
- **Filter**: If metal, clean with Cafiza; if paper, ensure no folding
- **Release pressure**: If stalled, pull plunger back slightly, then continue

## Section 8: Method-Specific Issues

### Espresso-Specific Problems

#### Problem 8.1: No Crema

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Stale coffee**: Use within 2 months, peak 1-4 weeks
- **Too dark roast**: Oils on surface interfere with crema formation
- **Low pressure**: Check pump function (should be 9 bar)
- **Grind too coarse**: Insufficient resistance for pressure build
- **Arabica vs Robusta**: Some origins produce less crema (not necessarily bad)

#### Problem 8.2: Excessive Crema

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Very fresh coffee**: Excessive CO₂, rest 10-14 days
- **Robusta content**: High Robusta blends produce excessive crema
- **Very fine grind**: May restrict flow too much
- **High dose**: Reduce slightly

#### Problem 8.3: Sour Shot After Bitter Shot (Same Coffee)

**Diagnosis**: This is channeling - some grounds over-extracted, others under
**Solution**: Focus on distribution and tamp consistency (see Problem 3.1)

### Pour-Over Specific Problems

#### Problem 8.4: V60 Always Too Fast

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Size wrong**: Using 01 with fine grind = fast; use 02
- **Pour too aggressive**: Creating channels
- **Grind distribution**: Too many boulders (upgrade grinder)
- **Paper filter**: Ensure size matches (01 vs 02 vs 03)

#### Problem 8.5: Kalita Wave Stalling

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Fine migration**: Fines clog three holes
- **Pour into holes**: Pour center, not into drain holes
- **Grind finer than Kalita needs**: Kalita needs medium, not medium-fine
- **Filter collapse**: Not enough water to maintain bed

### French Press Specific Problems

#### Problem 8.6: Difficult to Plunge

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Grind too fine**: Use coarser grind
- **Plunging too soon**: Wait for full steep time
- **Press deformed**: Check alignment of plunger and carafe
- **Over-filled**: Don't exceed max fill line

#### Problem 8.7: Grounds Escaping Filter

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Filter damaged**: Inspect mesh, replace if torn
- **Grind too fine**: Fines pass through mesh
- **Plunging too hard**: Creates turbulence
- **Filter loose**: Tighten filter assembly
- **Decanting solution**: Pour carefully into serving vessel

### AeroPress Specific Problems

#### Problem 8.8: Seal Failure (Inverted Method)

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Plunger not deep enough**: Insert at least 1 inch
- **Wet seal**: Dry plunger seal before inserting
- **Worn seal**: Replace if old or damaged

## Section 9: Water Quality Issues

### Problem 9.1: Flat, Dull Coffee Despite Everything

**Symptoms**:
- Coffee lacks brightness and clarity
- All flavor muted
- Occurs across all methods
- Different from under-extraction

**Root Cause**: Water too soft (low mineral content)

**Diagnostic**:
- Test TDS: Should be 75-250 mg/L
- Test hardness: Should be 50-100 ppm CaCO₃
- Distilled/RO water: Will produce flat coffee

**Solutions**:
- **Add minerals**: Third Wave Water, or DIY recipe
- **Different water**: Try bottled water (Crystal Geyser recommended)
- **Custom recipe**: See complete-water-guide.md
- **Target**: 50 ppm calcium, 20 ppm magnesium, 40 ppm bicarbonate

### Problem 9.2: Harsh, Metallic Coffee

**Symptoms**:
- Unpleasant metallic taste
- Harsh finish
- Not typical over-extraction bitterness
- Occurs in all methods

**Root Cause**: Water too hard or chlorine/chloramine

**Diagnostic**:
- Test TDS: > 250 mg/L indicates problem
- Smell water: Chlorine odor?
- Taste water: Metallic or chemical notes?

**Solutions**:
- **Carbon filter**: Removes chlorine/chloramine
- **Water softener**: If hardness > 150 ppm
- **Bottled water**: Temporary solution
- **RO + remineralization**: Ultimate control

### Problem 9.3: Inconsistent Results (Water-Related)

**Symptoms**:
- Good coffee some days, poor others
- No other variables changed
- Seasonal variation

**Root Cause**: Municipal water supply variation

**Solutions**:
- **Consistent source**: Bottled water, same brand
- **Home filtration**: BWT or similar
- **Monitor**: TDS meter to track water changes
- **Adjust**: Modify recipe based on water

## Section 10: Equipment Maintenance Issues

### Problem 10.1: Inconsistent Espresso (Equipment)

**Maintenance Checklist**:
- [ ] Clean group screen (daily)
- [ ] Backflush with detergent (weekly)
- [ ] Descale boiler (every 3-6 months based on water)
- [ ] Replace group gasket (annually or when worn)
- [ ] Replace shower screen (annually)
- [ ] Clean basket (weekly deep clean)
- [ ] Check water filter (replace per manufacturer)

### Problem 10.2: Slow Flow in Pour-Over (Equipment)

**Causes**:
- **Clogged filter**: Using reusable filter, needs deep clean
- **Scale buildup**: If using permanent filter
- **Worn equipment**: Scratched surfaces affect flow

**Solutions**:
- **Cloth filters**: Boil in water with small amount of detergent
- **Metal filters**: Soak in Cafiza solution
- **Cleaning**: Thorough rinse after each use

### Problem 10.3: Off-Flavors from Equipment

**Symptoms**:
- Soapy taste
- Rancid or stale flavors
- Plastic or rubber taste

**Causes and Solutions**:
- **Rancid oils**: Deep clean all equipment with Cafiza or Urnex
- **Soap residue**: Rinse thoroughly, avoid dish soap
- **Rubber gasket**: Replace old gaskets (French Press, Moka, Espresso)
- **Plastic taste**: New equipment - rinse repeatedly before use
- **Storage**: Ensure all equipment fully dry before storage

## Systematic Troubleshooting Protocol

When facing unclear or complex issues:

### Step 1: Isolate Variables

**Control everything except one variable**:
1. Use same coffee for all tests
2. Same grind setting
3. Same water (weigh, don't volume measure)
4. Same temperature
5. Same technique
6. Change ONE thing at a time

### Step 2: Baseline Establishment

**Create known good baseline**:
1. Use proven recipe from reputable source
2. Follow exactly as written
3. Document results
4. Use as comparison point

### Step 3: Methodical Adjustment

**Change variables in order**:
1. **Grind size** (most impactful, adjust first)
2. **Dose** (if grind adjustment insufficient)
3. **Temperature** (after dialing grind)
4. **Technique** (once parameters set)
5. **Equipment** (last resort)

### Step 4: Documentation

**Track all changes**:
- Date and time
- Coffee used (roast date, origin, roaster)
- Grind setting (number or visual reference)
- Recipe parameters (dose, water, ratio, temp)
- Time (total and checkpoints)
- Results (taste notes, TDS if measured)
- Changes made

### Step 5: Feedback Loop

**Iterate based on results**:
- Under-extracted → Increase extraction
- Over-extracted → Decrease extraction
- Uneven → Fix distribution/evenness
- Weak → Increase strength (dose or ratio)

## Common Mistakes by Experience Level

### Beginner Mistakes

1. **Measuring by volume, not weight**: Use scale for consistency
2. **Ignoring water quality**: Tap water varies significantly
3. **Not preheating equipment**: Major heat loss
4. **Inconsistent grind settings**: Write down settings
5. **Too many variables**: Change one thing at a time
6. **Blade grinder**: Upgrade to burr grinder ASAP
7. **Stale coffee**: Check roast date, use within 2-4 weeks

### Intermediate Mistakes

1. **Chasing TDS numbers**: Taste matters more than hitting exact numbers
2. **Over-complicating**: Simple recipe executed well beats complex recipe poorly
3. **Ignoring beans**: No amount of technique fixes bad/wrong coffee
4. **Neglecting maintenance**: Clean equipment regularly
5. **Confirmation bias**: Assume problem is grind when it's water/technique
6. **Equipment fetishism**: Skill beats equipment until high level

### Advanced Mistakes

1. **Over-optimization**: Chasing perfect at expense of enjoyment
2. **Ignoring basics**: Even experts forget to preheat sometimes
3. **Assumption that taste is universal**: Optimize for YOUR preference
4. **Over-reliance on measurement**: Trust taste over numbers
5. **Complexity for complexity's sake**: Simple methods often best

## Conclusion

Most coffee brewing problems stem from extraction issues:
- **Under-extraction**: Extract more (finer grind, hotter water, more time)
- **Over-extraction**: Extract less (coarser grind, cooler water, less time)
- **Uneven extraction**: Fix distribution, grinder, or technique

**The most important principle**: Change one variable at a time, taste the results, and iterate.

When in doubt:
1. Check your water quality
2. Verify coffee freshness
3. Ensure equipment is clean
4. Use a scale (weigh everything)
5. Control temperature
6. Focus on grind size first

**Remember**: The goal is not perfect extraction by the numbers, but coffee you enjoy drinking. Use scientific understanding as a tool to get there, not as an end in itself.
