# ⚙️ Grinder Burr Alignment and Performance

**Category**: Grinding Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand alignment's critical role in grind quality

---

## 📋 Overview

Burr alignment (how parallel/concentric burrs are) is grinder performance's foundation - perfect alignment creates narrow particle distribution with minimal fines/boulders, while misalignment creates wide distribution with excessive fines, boulders, and inconsistency. Understanding alignment explains grinder quality differences and enables DIY improvement.

**What is Burr Alignment**:
- **Definition**: How perfectly parallel (flat) or concentric (conical) burrs are
- **Perfect**: Consistent gap across entire burr surface
- **Misaligned**: Gap varies (wider one side, narrower other)
- **Impact**: Determines particle distribution quality

**Why Alignment Matters**:
- **Distribution**: Perfect alignment = narrow distribution
- **Consistency**: Alignment determines grind consistency
- **Espresso**: Critical for espresso (narrow distribution required)
- **Improvement**: Realigning poor grinder transforms performance
- **Value**: Alignment mod can make $200 grinder perform like $500

## 🔬 Alignment Effects

**Perfect Alignment**:
- **Consistent Gap**: All coffee experiences same cutting force
- **Narrow Distribution**: Minimal fines and boulders
- **Uniform**: Most particles near target size
- **Result**: Balanced extraction, clear flavors

**Misalignment** (Wobbly Burrs):
- **Variable Gap**: Some coffee cut too fine, some too coarse
- **Wide Distribution**: Excessive fines AND boulders simultaneously
- **Bimodal**: Two peaks (fines + targets), not one peak
- **Result**: Bitter + sour simultaneously, impossible to balance

## 🔧 Checking Alignment

**Visual Method**:
- **Marker Test**: Mark burrs, run coffee, check wear pattern
- **Shim Test**: Thin paper/foil between burrs at multiple points
- **Wobble**: Spin burr by hand, feel for wobble

**Professional**:
- **Dial Indicator**: Precision measurement tool
- **Laser**: Alignment checking (professional)

**Indicators of Misalignment**:
- Very wide particle distribution
- Espresso channeling despite good technique
- Inconsistent grind appearance
- One side of burrs wears faster

## 🛠️ Alignment Modification

**DIY Alignment** (Advanced):
- **Shimming**: Add thin shims to correct angle
- **Adjustment**: Loosen, realign, tighten carefully
- **Testing**: Iterative testing and adjustment
- **Caution**: Can void warranty, requires skill

**Professional Service**:
- Send grinder for professional alignment
- Burr replacement with alignment
- Worth investment for quality improvement

## 📝 Summary

Burr alignment determines grinder performance through particle distribution - perfect alignment creates narrow distribution with minimal fines/boulders (essential for espresso, beneficial for all methods), while misalignment creates wide distribution with excessive fines and boulders making balanced extraction impossible. Checking and correcting alignment can transform grinder performance dramatically.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Alignment**: How parallel/concentric burrs are
- **Perfect**: Narrow distribution, minimal fines/boulders
- **Misaligned**: Wide distribution, bimodal, inconsistent
- **Impact**: Determines grind quality more than burr type
- **Improvement**: Alignment mod dramatically improves performance
