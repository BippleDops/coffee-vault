## 📋 Overview

**Flavor Development** is the complex chemical transformation during roasting that creates coffee's characteristic flavors, aromas, and sensory properties. Understanding the science behind flavor formation enables precise roast profiling for desired characteristics.

**Key Insight**: Flavor develops through multiple simultaneous chemical reactions - managing these reactions through roast curves determines final cup quality.

## 🔬 Chemical Transformations

**1. [[Maillard Reaction Pathways|Maillard Reactions]]**:
- Amino acids + reducing sugars
- Forms thousands of flavor compounds
- Temperature: 140-200°C
- Produces: Roasty, nutty, caramel notes
- Most important flavor-forming reaction

**2. [[Sugar Caramelization in Coffee|Caramelization]]**:
- Sugar degradation and reformation
- Temperature: 170-200°C
- Produces: Caramel, toffee, sweet notes
- Contributes: Sweetness, brown flavors
- Precursor to many flavor compounds

**3. Strecker Degradation**:
- Amino acid breakdown
- Produces: Aldehydes, ketones
- Temperature: 150-200°C
- Contributes: Complexity, nutty notes
- Part of Maillard process

**4. Lipid Reactions**:
- Fat breakdown and oxidation
- Produces: Fatty acid degradation products
- Contributes: Body, mouthfeel, some aromas
- Manages: Body development

**5. Acid Transformation**:
- [[Organic Acids|Organic acid]] degradation
- [[Chlorogenic Acids and Antioxidants|Chlorogenic]] → [[Quinic Acid|quinic]]
- [[Citric Acid|Citric]] and [[Malic Acid|malic]] preservation
- Contributes: [[Perceived Acidity|Acidity]] profile
- Manages: Brightness, complexity

## 📊 Development Stages

**Green Coffee** (No Development):
- Raw, vegetal, grass-like
- High chlorogenic acids
- Undeveloped sugars
- No Maillard products
- No caramelization

**Early Development** (150-180°C):
- First crack onset
- Maillard begins
- Chlorogenic degradation starts
- Sugar transformation begins
- Green flavors fade

**Development Phase** (180-210°C):
- Active Maillard
- Caramelization progresses
- Acid transformation
- Flavor compounds form
- Complexity develops

**Advanced Development** (210-230°C):
- Extensive Maillard
- Full caramelization
- Complete acid transformation
- Complex flavor formation
- Body development
