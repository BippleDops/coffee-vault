# 💧 Alkalinity and pH in Coffee Brew Water

**Category**: Water Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand how alkalinity and pH affect coffee flavor

---

## 📋 Overview

Alkalinity and pH are critical water parameters that determine how brew water interacts with coffee's acids - too much alkalinity neutralizes brightness creating flat, chalky coffee; too little creates harsh, overly acidic cups. Understanding and controlling alkalinity enables balanced, pleasant acidity in brewed coffee.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Alkalinity**: Water's capacity to neutralize acids (buffering capacity)
- **pH**: Acidity/alkalinity measure (0-14 scale, 7 = neutral)
- **Bicarbonate**: Primary alkalinity source in water (HCO₃⁻)
- **Coffee Acidity**: Coffee naturally acidic (pH 4.8-5.2)
- **Buffering**: Alkalinity neutralizes coffee acids

**Ideal Ranges for Coffee**:
- **Alkalinity (KH)**: 40-75 ppm (as CaCO₃)
- **pH**: 6.5-7.5 (near neutral)

## 🔬 How Alkalinity Works

**Chemical Mechanism**:
- **Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)**: Weak base in water
- **Coffee Acids**: Citric, malic, chlorogenic acids in coffee
- **Reaction**: HCO₃⁻ + Acids → Neutralized → Balanced acidity in cup

**Effect on Coffee**:

**Low Alkalinity** (<30 ppm):
- **Result**: Very bright, acidic, sharp coffee
- **Can Be**: Too acidic, sour, harsh
- **Use**: Very acidic coffees (Kenya, Ethiopia) might need low alkalinity
- **Risk**: Overly aggressive acidity

**Optimal Alkalinity** (40-75 ppm):
- **Result**: Balanced acidity, pleasant brightness
- **Sweet Spot**: Brightness present but not overwhelming
- **Versatile**: Works for most coffees
- **Professional**: SCA recommended range

**High Alkalinity** (>100 ppm):
- **Result**: Flat, dull, chalky, muted coffee
- **Problem**: Over-neutralizes acids, loses brightness
- **Chalky**: Calcium carbonate taste
- **Fix**: Reduce alkalinity via RO, blending, or treatment

## 🎯 Matching Alkalinity to Coffee

**Bright, Acidic Coffees** (Kenya, Ethiopia, Light Roasts):
- **Alkalinity**: 50-75 ppm (higher buffer)
- **Why**: Tame brightness without flattening completely

**Balanced Coffees** (Colombia, Guatemala, Medium Roasts):
- **Alkalinity**: 40-60 ppm (moderate buffer)
- **Why**: Maintain balance

**Low-Acid Coffees** (Brazil, Sumatra, Dark Roasts):
- **Alkalinity**: 20-40 ppm (minimal buffer)
- **Why**: Don't over-neutralize already-low acidity

## 📝 Summary

Alkalinity is water's acid-buffering capacity - critically affecting coffee's perceived acidity and brightness. Optimal range (40-75 ppm) balances brightness without flatness; too high (>100 ppm) creates dull, chalky coffee; too low (<30 ppm) creates harsh acidity. Matching alkalinity to coffee type enables optimal acidity balance.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Alkalinity**: Acid-buffering capacity (40-75 ppm ideal)
- **Bicarbonate**: Primary alkalinity source
- **Effect**: Neutralizes coffee acids
- **Balance**: Critical for pleasant acidity
- **Adjust**: Match alkalinity to coffee acidity level
