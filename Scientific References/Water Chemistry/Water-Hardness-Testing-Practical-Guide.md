# Water Hardness Testing: Practical Guide

## Overview

Testing water chemistry transforms brewing from guesswork into science-based optimization. Simple, affordable tools enable home brewers to measure total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, and alkalinity—the three critical parameters affecting extraction and equipment longevity. Understanding what to measure, how to interpret results, and when to adjust water composition unlocks consistent, superior coffee.

This guide provides practical protocols for measuring water quality using accessible tools ($15-100 equipment), interpreting results against target ranges, and making informed decisions about filtration, remineralization, or source changes.

## Key Concepts

### Essential Water Parameters

**Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** - Overall mineral content:
- **What**: All dissolved minerals combined
- **Units**: ppm (parts per million) or mg/L
- **Target**: 75-150 ppm for espresso, 75-200 ppm for other methods
- **Tool**: TDS meter ($15-30)

**General Hardness (GH)** - Calcium + Magnesium:
- **What**: Divalent cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺)
- **Units**: ppm as CaCO₃ or °dH (German degrees)
- **Target**: 50-100 ppm as CaCO₃
- **Tool**: GH test drops (aquarium kit, $10-15)

**Carbonate Hardness/Alkalinity (KH)** - Bicarbonate buffer:
- **What**: Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) concentration
- **Units**: ppm as CaCO₃ or °dH
- **Target**: 20-60 ppm for espresso, 40-80 ppm for other methods
- **Tool**: KH test drops (aquarium kit, $10-15)

**Conversions**:
- 1°dH = 17.8 ppm as CaCO₃
- 1°dKH = 17.8 ppm bicarbonate as CaCO₃

### Why Each Parameter Matters

**TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**:
- Indicates overall mineral load
- Quick screening test
- Doesn't distinguish beneficial vs. problematic minerals
- **Use**: First-pass assessment

**GH (General Hardness)**:
- Measures extraction-enhancing minerals
- Predicts scale formation risk
- **Use**: Optimize extraction, prevent scale

**KH (Alkalinity)**:
- Measures acidity buffering
- Predicts final coffee pH
- **Use**: Balance brightness vs. flatness

## Practical Applications

### Testing Protocols

**Basic TDS testing** (5 minutes):
1. **Calibrate** TDS meter (if needed, use 342 ppm solution)
2. **Fill** clean cup with room-temp water
3. **Submerge** meter probe, wait 10 seconds
4. **Read** ppm value
5. **Interpret**:
   - <50 ppm: Too soft (remineralize)
   - 75-150 ppm: Ideal range
   - >200 ppm: Too hard (filter or dilute)

**GH test drops** (5 minutes):
1. **Fill** test vial to mark (5mL typical)
2. **Add** GH reagent drops, one at a time
3. **Swirl** after each drop
4. **Count** drops until color changes (blue→orange typical)
5. **Calculate**: Drops × conversion factor = °dH or ppm
   - Example: 5 drops × 1°dH/drop = 5°dH = 89 ppm GH
6. **Target**: 3-6°dH (50-100 ppm)

**KH test drops** (5 minutes):
1. Same procedure as GH test
2. Different reagent (KH drops)
3. Count drops to color change
4. **Target**: 2-4°dH (35-70 ppm for espresso)

**Comprehensive lab test** ($30-50):
- Send water sample to Ward Labs or similar
- Receives full mineral profile:
  - Ca, Mg, Na, K (cations)
  - HCO₃, Cl, SO₄ (anions)
  - TDS, pH, hardness
- **Use**: When optimizing custom water recipes

### Interpreting Results

**Example 1: "Good" water**:
- TDS: 110 ppm
- GH: 70 ppm (4°dH)
- KH: 50 ppm (3°dKH)
- **Assessment**: Ideal for espresso, brew as-is

**Example 2: "Soft" water**:
- TDS: 35 ppm
- GH: 20 ppm (1°dH)
- KH: 15 ppm (1°dKH)
- **Assessment**: Under-extraction risk, remineralize

**Example 3: "Hard" water**:
- TDS: 280 ppm
- GH: 200 ppm (11°dH)
- KH: 180 ppm (10°dKH)
- **Assessment**: Scale risk, over-buffered, filter/dilute

**Example 4: "Unbalanced" water**:
- TDS: 150 ppm
- GH: 40 ppm (2°dH)
- KH: 110 ppm (6°dKH)
- **Assessment**: High alkalinity, will flatten coffee, reduce KH

### Solutions by Test Results

**Too soft** (<50 ppm TDS):
- **Option 1**: Third Wave Water packets (easiest)
- **Option 2**: DIY minerals (0.4g Epsom salt + 0.3g K-bicarb per gallon)
- **Option 3**: Blend with harder water (if available)

**Too hard** (>200 ppm TDS):
- **Option 1**: Dilute with distilled (e.g., 50/50 blend)
- **Option 2**: Reverse osmosis system + remineralize
- **Option 3**: Ion exchange filter (caution: may over-soften)

**High GH, low KH** (ideal for extraction):
- **Good**: Strong extraction, low buffering
- **Use**: As-is, excellent profile
- **Watch**: Potential for thin acidity (taste-dependent)

**High KH, low GH** (poor balance):
- **Problem**: Over-buffered, flat coffee, weak extraction
- **Solution**: Add hardness (Epsom salt) while reducing KH (RO blend)

## Tools and Equipment

### Essential Kit ($30-60 total)

**TDS Meter** ($15-30):
- Recommended: HM Digital TDS-3 or similar
- 0-999 ppm range sufficient
- Calibration: 342 ppm solution
- Battery-powered, portable

**GH/KH Test Kit** ($15-30):
- API GH/KH Test Kit (aquarium section)
- 100+ tests per bottle
- Drops-based (simple, no equipment)
- Accurate to ±1°dH (±18 ppm)

**Optional**: pH meter ($20-50)

### Professional Tools ($100-500)

**Hanna HI98129** (Combo meter, $60-80):

## Common Misconceptions

### "TDS alone tells you everything"

**Reality**: TDS indicates total minerals but doesn't show composition. 100 ppm could be ideal (Ca + Mg + HCO₃) or problematic (Na + Cl). Need GH/KH for full picture.

### "0 ppm water is pure and best"

**Reality**: Distilled/RO water (0-5 ppm) severely under-extracts and tastes flat. Always remineralize to 75-150 ppm.

### "My tap water says <200 ppm so it's fine"

**Reality**: Composition matters as much as total. 180 ppm mostly as calcium (good) differs from 180 ppm as sodium bicarbonate (bad).

### "Expensive meters are necessary"

**Reality**: $20 TDS meter + $15 GH/KH drops provide 95% of needed information. Expensive equipment helps professionals but isn't required for home brewing.
