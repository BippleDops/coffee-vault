## 🔬 Water Chemistry Fundamentals

### Key Parameters

**TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**:
- **Definition**: Total concentration of all dissolved minerals
- **Measurement**: Parts per million (ppm) or mg/L (same thing)
- **Ideal Range for Coffee**: 80-150 ppm
- **Effects**:
  - Too low (<50 ppm): Under-extraction, flat, dull
  - Optimal (80-150 ppm): Balanced extraction, flavorful
  - Too high (>200 ppm): Over-extraction, muddled, harsh
- **Measurement**: TDS meter (~$15-50)

**GH (General Hardness)**:
- **Definition**: Concentration of calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺)
- **Measurement**: ppm as CaCO₃ equivalent
- **Ideal Range**: 50-100 ppm for coffee
- **Role**: Primary extraction minerals
  - **Calcium**: Extracts acids, brightness, clarity
  - **Magnesium**: Extracts body, sweetness, fuller flavors
- **Effects**:
  - Too low: Thin, sour, under-extracted
  - Optimal: Balanced, full extraction
  - Too high: Bitter, harsh, over-extracted, scale buildup

**KH (Carbonate Hardness / Alkalinity)**:
- **Definition**: Concentration of bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and carbonate (CO₃²⁻)
- **Measurement**: ppm as CaCO₃ equivalent
- **Ideal Range**: 40-75 ppm for coffee
- **Role**: Buffers acidity
  - **Low alkalinity**: Bright, acidic coffee
  - **High alkalinity**: Muted acidity, chalky, flat
- **Effects**:
  - Too low (<20 ppm): Overly acidic, sour, harsh
  - Optimal (40-75 ppm): Balanced acidity, pleasant
  - Too high (>100 ppm): Flat, dull, chalky, muted

**pH**:
- **Definition**: Acidity/alkalinity of water (logarithmic scale 0-14)
- **Neutral**: pH 7.0
- **Ideal for Coffee**: 6.5-7.5 (near neutral)
- **Effects**:
  - Low pH (<6.5, acidic water): Can emphasize sourness
  - Optimal (6.5-7.5): Balanced
  - High pH (>7.5, alkaline): Flat, chalky coffee
- **Note**: pH is less critical than GH and KH for coffee

**Sodium (Na⁺)**:
- **Ideal**: <10 ppm (minimal)
- **Problem**: Adds salty taste, no extraction benefit
- **Source**: Water softeners (avoid for coffee)

**Chlorine/Chloramine**:
- **Ideal**: 0 ppm (none)
- **Problem**: Chemical taste, off-flavors, damages coffee
- **Solution**: Carbon filtration removes chlorine; chloramine requires specific filters

## 💡 How Minerals Affect Coffee Extraction

### Extraction Mechanism

**Coffee Brewing is Selective Dissolution**:
- Water dissolves flavor compounds from ground coffee
- Minerals in water act as "carriers" for different compounds
- Different minerals extract different flavor categories

### Mineral Roles in Extraction

**Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** - The Body & Sweetness Extractor:
- **Extracts**: Sweetness, body, fuller flavors, heavier compounds
- **Mechanism**: Mg²⁺ binds to carboxylic acid groups on coffee molecules
- **Effect on Cup**:
  - **High Mg**: Full body, sweet, round, rich
  - **Low Mg**: Thin body, less sweetness
- **Ideal**: 20-30 ppm (higher end of range for body-focused)
- **Example**: Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) used in recipes

**Calcium (Ca²⁺)** - The Brightness & Clarity Extractor:
- **Extracts**: Acids, brightness, fruity notes, clarity
- **Mechanism**: Ca²⁺ binds to acidic compounds, enhancing extraction
- **Effect on Cup**:
  - **High Ca**: Bright, acidic, clear, articulate
  - **Low Ca**: Dull, muted, less acidity
- **Ideal**: 30-50 ppm (higher for bright coffees)
- **Example**: Calcium chloride or gypsum (calcium sulfate) in recipes

**Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)** - The Acidity Buffer:
- **Role**: Neutralizes acids in coffee
- **Mechanism**: Bicarbonate is a base that reacts with acids
- **Effect on Cup**:
  - **High bicarbonate**: Muted acidity, flat, chalky
  - **Low bicarbonate**: Very bright, can be harsh/sour
  - **Optimal**: Balances acidity to pleasant levels
- **Ideal**: 40-75 ppm (higher for very acidic coffees like Kenya)
- **Example**: Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) in recipes

### The Mg:Ca Ratio

**Balance Matters**:
- **Ratio**: Magnesium to Calcium ratio affects flavor balance
- **Body-Focused**: Higher Mg ratio (e.g., 2:1 Mg:Ca) = full body, sweet
- **Brightness-Focused**: Higher Ca ratio (e.g., 1:2 Mg:Ca) = bright, acidic
- **Balanced**: ~1:1 ratio = balanced extraction

**Examples**:
- **Mg-Heavy (2:1)**: 30 ppm Mg, 15 ppm Ca - For full-bodied, chocolatey coffees
- **Balanced (1:1)**: 25 ppm Mg, 25 ppm Ca - For balanced, versatile use
- **Ca-Heavy (1:2)**: 20 ppm Mg, 40 ppm Ca - For bright, acidic coffees (Kenya, Ethiopia)

## 🎯 Matching Water to Coffee

### Coffee Characteristics

**Bright, Acidic Coffees** (Kenya, Ethiopia, Light Roasts):
- **Strategy**: Moderate alkalinity to balance acidity, Ca-focused hardness for clarity
- **Target**:
  - GH: 60-80 ppm (higher Ca)
  - KH: 50-75 ppm (higher buffer)
  - Mg:Ca ratio: 1:2 (Ca dominant)
- **Why**: High alkalinity tames brightness without flattening; Ca enhances fruit notes

**Full-Bodied, Chocolatey Coffees** (Brazil, Sumatra, Dark Roasts):
- **Strategy**: Lower alkalinity for more extraction, Mg-focused for body
- **Target**:
  - GH: 70-100 ppm (higher Mg)
  - KH: 20-40 ppm (lower buffer)
  - Mg:Ca ratio: 2:1 (Mg dominant)
- **Why**: Low alkalinity doesn't mute flavors; Mg enhances body and sweetness

**Balanced Coffees** (Colombia, Guatemala, Medium Roasts):
- **Strategy**: Balanced minerals, moderate alkalinity
- **Target**:
  - GH: 60-80 ppm (balanced Mg:Ca)
  - KH: 40-60 ppm (moderate buffer)
