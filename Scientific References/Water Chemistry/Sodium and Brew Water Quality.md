# 💧 Sodium and Brew Water Quality

**Category**: Water Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand sodium's negative effects on coffee

---

## 📋 Overview

Sodium in brew water adds salty taste and provides no extraction benefit - making it coffee's least desirable water mineral. Understanding sodium sources (especially water softeners) enables avoidance, preserving coffee flavor and preventing salty, flat cups.

**Why Sodium is Bad for Coffee**:
- **Salty Taste**: Adds saltiness (undesirable in coffee)
- **No Extraction Benefit**: Doesn't help extract flavor compounds
- **Flat**: Can make coffee taste flat, dull
- **Avoid**: Keep sodium <10 ppm (ideally <5 ppm)

**Sodium Sources**:
1. **Water Softeners**: Ion exchange (Ca/Mg → Na) - AVOID
2. **Baking Soda**: Sodium bicarbonate (use minimal)
3. **Municipal Water**: Some cities naturally high sodium

## ⚠️ Water Softener Problem

**How Softeners Work**:
- Remove calcium and magnesium (hardness)
- Replace with sodium
- **Result**: High sodium, low Ca/Mg = terrible for coffee

**Effect on Coffee**:
- **Salty**: Noticeable saltiness
- **Poor Extraction**: No Ca/Mg means poor extraction
- **Flat**: Dull, lifeless coffee
- **Avoid**: NEVER use softened water for coffee

**Solution**:
- Bypass water softener for coffee tap
- Use unsoftened water source
- RO + remineralization with Ca/Mg (no sodium)

## 📝 Summary

Sodium adds saltiness without extraction benefit - keep below 10 ppm (ideally <5 ppm) by avoiding water softeners (replace Ca/Mg with Na), minimizing baking soda, and checking municipal water reports. Water softener water is terrible for coffee (salty, poor extraction).

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Sodium**: Salty taste, no extraction benefit
- **Avoid**: Keep <10 ppm, ideally <5 ppm
- **Water Softeners**: NEVER use for coffee
- **Solution**: Bypass softener, use hard water or RO + Ca/Mg
