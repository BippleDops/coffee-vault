# 💧 Wet Processing Water Usage and Conservation

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand water usage and conservation in processing

---

## 📋 Overview

Wet processing requires significant water - with traditional methods using 50-150 liters per kg coffee processed, creating environmental concerns and driving innovations in water conservation through recirculation, eco-pulpers, and alternative processing (honey, mechanical demucilaging).

**Water Usage**:
- **Traditional Wet**: 50-150 liters per kg green coffee
- **Eco-Pulper**: 10-20 liters per kg (80-90% reduction)
- **Honey Process**: Minimal water (depulping only)
- **Natural**: Zero water (dry processing)

**Why Conservation Matters**:
- **Environmental**: Water scarcity in some regions
- **Cost**: Water pumping, treatment costs
- **Pollution**: Wastewater contamination if untreated
- **Sustainability**: Resource efficiency essential

## 💧 Conservation Methods

**Eco-Pulpers**:
- **Mechanical Mucilage Removal**: No fermentation tanks
- **Water Savings**: 80-90% reduction
- **Quality**: Acceptable for honey process

**Recirculation**:
- **Reuse**: Water used multiple times
- **Treatment**: Settling, filtration between uses
- **Savings**: 50-70% reduction

**Honey Processing**:
- **Minimal Water**: Only depulping water needed
- **No Fermentation**: No fermentation tank water
- **Savings**: 70-90% vs. fully washed

## 📝 Summary

Wet processing water usage (50-150 L/kg traditional) is reduced through eco-pulpers (80-90% savings), recirculation (50-70% savings), and honey processing (70-90% savings vs. washed), enabling sustainable processing while maintaining quality.
