## 🔄 The Washed Processing Journey

### Timeline Overview

| Stage | Duration | Key Activity |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Harvest | Varies | Selective picking of ripe cherries |
| Reception | 0-2 hours | Sorting and density separation |
| Depulping | 2-4 hours | Mechanical removal of skin and fruit |
| Fermentation | 12-48 hours | Enzymatic breakdown of mucilage |
| Washing | 1-2 hours | Removal of fermented mucilage |
| Drying | 7-14 days | Reduction to 10-12% moisture |
| Dry Milling | As needed | Removal of parchment layer |

**Total Time**: 10-21 days from cherry to green bean

## 🍒 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Harvest and Reception

**Selective Picking**:
- Only ripe cherries harvested (ideally 95%+ ripe)
- Multiple passes through trees
- Visual assessment: deep red or yellow (for yellow varieties)
- Firmness test: cherries should feel full and slightly firm

**Reception and Initial Sorting**:
1. Cherries arrive at processing facility (wet mill)
2. Immediate visual inspection for defects
3. Remove leaves, sticks, unripe or overripe cherries
4. Process within 6-12 hours of picking (sooner is better)

**Why Speed Matters**:
- Minimizes fermentation starting in cherry
- Prevents spoilage and off-flavors
- Maintains coffee quality potential

### Step 2: Density Separation (Float/Sink)

**Water Channel Flotation**:
1. Cherries poured into water channel or tank
2. **Floaters** (defects): Underripe, insect-damaged, dried cherries float
3. **Sinkers** (quality): Ripe, dense cherries sink to bottom
4. Floaters skimmed off and discarded or processed separately
5. Sinkers move forward to depulping

**Science Behind It**:
- Ripe cherries have higher sugar content = higher density
- Damaged cherries have air pockets = lower density
- Simple gravity separation for quality control

**Water Considerations**:
- Clean, fresh water preferred
- Traditional method uses significant water
- Modern eco-pulping reduces water dramatically

### Step 3: Depulping (Pulping)

**Mechanical Pulp Removal**:
1. Cherries pass through depulping machine
2. Adjustable plates create pressure
3. Skin (exocarp) and most fruit (mesocarp) removed
4. Coffee beans (seeds) in mucilage layer emerge
5. Pulp separated and removed

**Key Machine Settings**:
- Gap between plates critical (too tight = bean damage, too loose = incomplete pulping)
- Typical gap: 0.5-1.5mm depending on bean size
- Regular adjustment needed for bean size variation

**What Remains After Depulping**:
- **Parchment** (endocarp): Protective layer around bean
- **Mucilage** (also called "honey"): Sticky, sugar-rich layer adhering to parchment
- **Silver skin** (seed coat): Thin layer between bean and parchment

**Common Issues**:
- **Bean damage**: Improper settings can crush or nick beans
- **Incomplete depulping**: Requires reprocessing
- **Mixed maturity**: Underripe cherries won't depulp properly

### Step 4: Fermentation

**Purpose**: Enzymatic breakdown of sticky mucilage layer

**The Science**:
- Mucilage contains pectin, sugars, proteins
- Natural microbes (bacteria, yeasts) metabolize sugars
- Enzymes break down pectin structure
- Mucilage liquefies and can be washed away

**Fermentation Methods**:

**Dry Fermentation** (Traditional):
- Depulped beans placed in fermentation tanks
- No water added
- Natural fermentation from bean-surface microorganisms
- Duration: 12-36 hours typically
- Temperature-dependent (warmer = faster)

**Wet Fermentation**:
- Beans submerged in water in tanks
- Anaerobic conditions
- Sometimes used in specific regions
- Duration: 12-24 hours typically

**Factors Affecting Fermentation Time**:

1. **Temperature**:
   - 20-25°C (68-77°F): 12-24 hours
   - 25-30°C (77-86°F): 8-16 hours
   - <20°C (68°F): 24-48 hours

2. **Altitude**:
   - Higher altitude = cooler temps = longer fermentation
   - Lower altitude = warmer temps = shorter fermentation

3. **Microbial Population**:
   - Established facilities have "house microbiome"
   - New facilities take time to develop stable populations
   - Regional differences in native microbes

**Monitoring Fermentation**:

**Visual Tests**:
- Mucilage becomes loose and slimy
- Parchment becomes rough textured
- Bubbles appear (CO2 from fermentation)

**Touch Test**:
- Grab handful of beans
- Rub between hands
- Should feel gritty, not slimy
- Parchment should be rough like sandpaper

**Sound Test**:
- Place beans in bucket
- Shake vigorously
- Should make rattling sound (not squishy sound)

**pH Monitoring** (Advanced):
- Start pH: ~5.5-6.0
- End pH: ~4.0-4.5
- Acid production indicates active fermentation
- Modern facilities track pH precisely

**Risks of Fermentation**:

**Under-Fermentation**:
- Mucilage remains sticky
- Difficult to wash completely
- Can lead to "off" flavors in cup
- Extended drying time needed

**Over-Fermentation**:
- "Stinker" defect: vinegary, over-fermented flavor
- Degradation of bean quality
- Acetic acid development (sharp, unpleasant)
- Irreversible damage to flavor

**Optimal Window**:
- Fully degraded mucilage
- Before over-fermentation begins
- Requires experience and monitoring
- "Goldilocks zone": just right

### Step 5: Washing

**Mucilage Removal**:
1. Fermented beans moved to washing channels
2. Vigorous agitation in flowing water
3. Loose mucilage washed away
4. Multiple wash cycles often used
5. Final rinse produces clean parchment

**Traditional Washing Channels**:
- Long concrete channels
- Running water flows through
- Beans agitated by water flow or manually
- Multiple density separations occur

**Modern Washing Systems**:
- Mechanical washers reduce water use
- Rotating drums with water jets
- Centrifugal washers in some facilities
- Recirculating water systems

**Water Usage**:
- Traditional: 30-40 liters per kg green coffee
- Modern eco-washers: 1-5 liters per kg
- Water recycling and treatment increasingly common

**Quality Check**:
- Parchment should feel clean, gritty
- No slime remaining
- Uniform appearance
- Ready for drying

### Step 6: Drying

**Goal**: Reduce moisture from ~55% to 10-12%

**Drying Methods**:

**Patio/Terrace Sun Drying** (Traditional):
- Parchment spread on raised beds or patios
- Direct sunlight exposure
- Raked regularly for even drying
- Covered during midday heat or rain
- Duration: 7-14 days
- Labor intensive but low tech

**Raised Bed/African Bed Drying**:
- Mesh tables raised off ground
- Air circulation from below
- More even drying than patios
- Protection from ground moisture
- Popular in specialty coffee
- Duration: 8-14 days

**Mechanical Drying** (Guardiolas):
- Rotating drums with heat source
- Faster but requires fuel
- Risk of over-heating if not careful
- Often combined with sun drying
- Duration: 24-48 hours mechanical + sun

**Combined Method** (Hybrid):
- Start with sun drying (days 1-5)
- Finish with mechanical (days 6-8)
- Best of both: quality + speed
- Reduced weather dependency

**Drying Best Practices**:

**Layer Thickness**:
- Thin layers dry faster, more evenly
- 2-4 cm depth ideal for raised beds
- Turn/rake every 1-2 hours

**Temperature Management**:
- Avoid exceeding 40°C (104°F)
- High heat degrades quality
- Slow, steady drying preferred
- Night: cover or move indoors

**Moisture Monitoring**:
- Start: ~55% moisture
- Target: 10-12% moisture
- Use moisture meter for precision
- Test multiple spots in batch

**Drying Curve**:
- Ideal: Gradual, consistent moisture loss
- Avoid: Rapid drying (case hardening)
- Avoid: Stopping/starting (uneven moisture)

### Step 7: Dry Rest (Reposo)

**Purpose**: Moisture equilibration

**Process**:
- Dried parchment stored in bags or bins
- Rest period: 1-4 weeks
- Allows moisture to equalize throughout bean
- Stabilization before dry milling

**Why It Matters**:
- Surface may be dry while interior retains moisture
- Rest period allows moisture migration
- Prevents damage during dry milling
- Improves cup quality and stability

### Step 8: Dry Milling (Hulling)

**Parchment Removal**:
1. Dried parchment passes through hulling machine
2. Mechanical abrasion removes brittle parchment layer
3. Silver skin mostly removed (some remains)
4. Green beans emerge

**Grading and Sorting**:
- Screen size separation
- Density sorting (catador or table)
- Optical sorting (modern facilities)
- Hand-sorting for final quality check
- Defect removal

**Final Product**:
- Clean, green coffee beans
- Ready for export or roasting
- Stable at 10-12% moisture
- Can be stored 6-12 months properly
