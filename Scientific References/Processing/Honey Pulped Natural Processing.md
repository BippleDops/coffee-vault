# Honey and Pulped Natural Processing

## Overview

Honey processing (also called pulped natural) is a hybrid method combining aspects of washed and natural processing. It creates unique flavor profiles between the two extremes and offers processing flexibility for producers.

## What is Honey Processing?

### Definition

**Honey Processing**:
- Cherry skin/pulp removed (like washed)
- Mucilage left on bean during drying (unlike washed)
- Dried with sticky mucilage layer intact
- Name from sticky, honey-like mucilage (not actual honey)

**Mucilage**:
- Sweet, sticky layer surrounding parchment
- Contains sugars, pectins, proteins
- Creates unique flavors during drying
- Variable removal levels create processing variations

## Processing Categories

### Honey Color Classifications

**White Honey**:
- 80-90% mucilage removed
- Closest to washed
- Light, clean profile
- Shortest drying time

**Yellow Honey**:
- 50-75% mucilage removed
- Moderate body and sweetness
- Balanced characteristics
- Most common honey type

**Red Honey**:
- 25-50% mucilage removed
- Fuller body
- More complex
- Sweeter than yellow

**Black Honey**:
- 0-25% mucilage removed
- Almost like natural
- Very fruity, heavy body
- Longest drying time
- Most complex

**Gold Honey** (less common):
- Between yellow and red
- Regional variation
- Not standardized

### Regional Naming Variations

**Central America**:
- Honey processing terminology standard
- Color-based classification
- Well-defined categories

**Costa Rica**:
- Pioneered modern honey processing
- Most refined categorization
- Quality focus

**Other Regions**:
- "Pulped natural" (Brazil)
- "Semi-washed" (some regions)
- Terminology less standardized

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Harvesting

**Requirement**:
- Ripe cherry selection
- Same as washed processing
- Selective picking preferred
- Ripeness critical

### Step 2: Depulping

**Mechanical Removal**:
- Machine removes skin and pulp
- Leaves parchment and mucilage
- Pressure-controlled for mucilage retention
- Different settings for honey levels

**Mucilage Retention**:
- Adjustable by depulper settings
- Water amount used
- Pressure level
- Equipment type

### Step 3: Drying with Mucilage

**Drying Process**:
- Spread on raised beds or patios
- Sticky mucilage makes handling difficult
- Requires careful monitoring
- Must turn regularly

**Duration by Type**:
- White honey: 8-10 days
- Yellow honey: 10-15 days
- Red honey: 15-20 days
- Black honey: 20-25 days

**Challenges**:
- Stickiness makes turning hard
- Fermentation risk (sugar in mucilage)
- Mold risk if not monitored
- Requires more attention than washed

### Step 4: Hulling

**Removing Parchment**:
- Once dried to 10-12% moisture
- Mechanical hulling
- Similar to other processes
- Dried mucilage comes off with parchment

## Flavor Characteristics

### Honey vs Other Methods

**vs Washed**:
- More body (from mucilage sugars)
- More sweetness
- Less bright acidity
- More complex

**vs Natural**:
- Cleaner than natural
- Less fruity/funky
- More consistent
- Lighter body than natural

**Unique Profile**:
- Balance between methods
- Sweet and complex
- Creamy mouthfeel
- Moderate acidity

### Flavor Development

**Mucilage Contribution**:
- Sugars absorbed during drying
- Creates sweetness in cup
- Adds body and viscosity
- Develops caramel notes
