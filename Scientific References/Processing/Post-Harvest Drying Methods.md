# Post-Harvest Drying Methods

## Overview

Drying is a critical post-harvest step affecting coffee quality, stability, and flavor. Understanding drying methods and parameters helps optimize quality and prevent defects.

## Drying Principles

### Target Moisture

**Standard**:
- Green coffee: 10-12% moisture
- Below 10%: Too dry (brittle, ages faster)
- Above 12%: Mold risk, instability
- 11-12%: Ideal for most markets

### Why Drying Matters

**Quality**:
- Prevents mold growth
- Stops fermentation
- Stabilizes beans
- Enables storage

**Flavor**:
- Drying rate affects flavor development
- Too fast: Can create defects
- Too slow: Fermentation risk
- Optimal rate: Quality

## Drying Methods

### 1. Patio Drying

**Traditional Method**:
- Concrete or brick patios
- Direct sun exposure
- Manual raking/turning
- Large surface areas

**Advantages**:
- Low cost
- Simple equipment
- Traditional
- Large capacity

**Disadvantages**:
- Weather dependent
- Contamination risk
- Inconsistent drying
- Labor intensive

**Quality Factors**:
- Layer thickness (5-10cm)
- Regular turning (prevent fermentation)
- Protection from rain
- Contamination prevention

### 2. Raised Bed Drying

**Modern Standard**:
- Slatted wooden platforms
- Airflow from below
- Can be covered
- Better control

**Advantages**:
- Even drying (air circulation)
- Better quality
- Weather protection possible
- Reduced contamination

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher cost
- Requires construction
- Smaller capacity per area
- More infrastructure

**Quality Factors**:
- Bed height (allows airflow)
- Mesh/slat spacing
- Covering in rain
- Turning schedule

### 3. Greenhouse Drying

**Protected Drying**:
- Transparent covering
- Natural heat
- Rain protection
- Controlled environment

**Advantages**:
- Weather independent
- Extended drying possible
- Quality control
- Reduced labor (less turning)

**Disadvantages**:
- Significant investment
- Temperature management needed
- Potential overheating
- Maintenance

### 4. Mechanical Drying

**Industrial Method**:
- Forced hot air
- Temperature controlled
- Fast drying
- Consistent

**Advantages**:
- Weather independent
- Fast (12-24 hours possible)
- Consistent results
- High throughput

**Disadvantages**:
- High cost (equipment, fuel)
- Can reduce quality if too hot
- Less traditional flavor
- Energy intensive

**Quality Considerations**:
- Temperature: Keep below 40°C
- Gradual moisture reduction
- Airflow management
- Not too fast

## Drying Curves

### Ideal Drying Rate

**Phases**:

**Phase 1** (Days 1-5):
- Rapid moisture loss
- 50% → 30%
- More frequent turning
- Active monitoring

**Phase 2** (Days 6-10):
- Moderate loss
- 30% → 18%
- Slower drying
- Risk of over-drying surface

**Phase 3** (Days 11-15):
- Slow, final drying
- 18% → 11-12%
- Equilibrium approaching
- Patience required

### Duration by Method

**Patio**: 12-20 days (weather-dependent)
**Raised Beds**: 10-15 days
**Greenhouse**: 8-12 days
**Mechanical**: 12-48 hours

## Quality Control

### Moisture Measurement

**Tools**:
- Moisture meter (required)
- Sample from multiple locations
- Test throughout batch
- Regular measurements

**Testing Protocol**:
- Daily measurements
- Multiple samples
- Record data
- Adjust drying accordingly

### Visual and Sensory Checks

**Appearance**:
- Color changes (yellowish to green)
- Parchment dryness
- No mold visible
- Even color

**Smell**:
- Sweet, grain-like when proper
- Musty = problem
- Sour = fermentation issue
- Fresh = good

**Feel**:
- Parchment brittle when dry
- Beans rattle in parchment
- Appropriate hardness

## Drying Defects

### Too-Fast Drying

**Case Hardening**:
- Surface dries too fast
- Traps moisture inside
- Cracks develop
- Quality reduction

**Prevention**:
- Gradual drying
- Not too thin layers initially
- Temperature control
- Proper ventilation

### Too-Slow Drying

**Fermentation**:
- Continued microbial activity
- Off-flavors develop
- Sour notes
- Quality degradation

**Mold**:
- Visible mold growth
- Mycotoxins possible
- Health hazard
- Total loss

**Prevention**:
- Adequate air circulation
- Regular turning
- Monitor moisture
- Weather awareness

### Uneven Drying

**Problem**:
- Some beans overdried
- Others underdried
- Inconsistent quality
- Mixed moisture levels

**Causes**:
- Insufficient turning
- Thick layers
- Poor air circulation
- Variable bean sizes

**Prevention**:
- Regular, thorough turning
- Appropriate layer depth
- Uniform spreading
- Size grading

## Regional Practices
