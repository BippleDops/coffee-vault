# 🍷 Carbonic Maceration in Coffee Processing

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Origin**: Wine Industry (Beaujolais), Adapted to Coffee (2015+)

---

## 📋 Overview

Carbonic maceration is wine industry's Beaujolais technique adapted to coffee - fermenting whole cherries in CO₂-rich, oxygen-free environment to create intracellular fermentation producing intensely fruity, wine-like, complex coffees with unique flavor profiles impossible through traditional processing.

**What is Carbonic Maceration**:
- **Definition**: Fermentation of intact cherries in CO₂ atmosphere (no oxygen)
- **Wine Inspiration**: Beaujolais wine technique (creates fruity, easy-drinking wines)
- **Intracellular**: Fermentation happens INSIDE intact cherries (not external like normal)
- **CO₂ Environment**: Tank flooded with carbon dioxide, displacing oxygen
- **Whole Cherries**: Unlike standard fermentation (depulped beans)
- **Unique Flavors**: Fruit-forward, wine-like, complex, funky

**Why Coffee Adapted It**:
- **Differentiation**: Create unique, unmistakable flavor profiles
- **Premium**: Commands $25-80+/lb green for experimental lots
- **Competition**: Wins awards, media attention
- **Innovation**: Pushes processing boundaries
- **Farmer Value**: Value-addition through processing innovation

## 🔬 The Science

**Standard Fermentation**: External, aerobic/anaerobic bacteria on bean surface

**Carbonic Maceration**: Intracellular (inside intact cherry cells)

**Process**:
1. **Whole Cherries**: Intact, unbroken cherries in sealed tank
2. **CO₂ Injection**: Tank flooded with CO₂, displaces oxygen
3. **Pressure**: Slight pressure buildup (sometimes vented)
4. **Intracellular Fermentation**: Enzymes inside cherry cells break down sugars without oxygen
   - Creates unique flavor compounds
   - Different from surface fermentation
   - No microorganisms initially (sterile inside cherry)
5. **Duration**: 24-72+ hours typically
6. **Cherry Rupture**: Eventually cherries break down
7. **Secondary Fermentation**: External fermentation begins when cherries rupture
8. **Processing Continues**: After carbonic phase, typically processed as natural or honey

**Chemical Byproducts**:
- **Unique Esters**: Fruity aroma compounds
- **Alcohols**: Wine-like, boozy notes
- **Organic Acids**: Different profile than standard fermentation
- **Complexity**: Layered chemical development

## ☕ Flavor Impact

**Typical Carbonic Maceration Coffee**:
- **Wine-Like**: Red wine, fermented fruit, boozy, vinous
- **Tropical Fruit**: Intense tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, passion fruit)
- **Berry**: Mixed berries, berry compote, jammy
- **Funky**: Wine-like funk, fermented complexity
- **Unique**: Unlike any other coffee processing
- **Polarizing**: Love it or find it too extreme

**Sensory**:
- **Acidity**: Variable - can be bright or muted depending on details
- **Body**: Full - Syrupy, viscous, coating
- **Sweetness**: Very High - Fruit sugars, wine-like sweetness
- **Complexity**: Extreme - Multi-layered, challenging
- **Clean**: Can be clean or funky (intentional variation)
