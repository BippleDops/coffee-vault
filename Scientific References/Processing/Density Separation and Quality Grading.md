# ⚖️ Density Separation and Quality Grading

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Density separation removes low-quality beans through floatation and gravity tables - with dense beans (quality) sinking while defective beans float, creating clean specialty-grade lots.

**Why Density Matters**:
- **Quality Indicator**: Dense beans = slow maturation = quality
- **Defect Removal**: Floaters = defects, remove
- **Specialty Grade**: Requires density sorting

---

## 🔬 Methods

**Floatation**: Water tanks, defects float  
**Gravity Table** (Catador): Vibrating table, beans slide by density  
**Multiple Passes**: Repeated sorting for specialty

---

## 📝 Summary

Density separation removes defects through floatation (defects float, quality sinks) and gravity tables - essential for specialty-grade coffee requiring clean, uniform, dense beans.
