# ✅ Post-Harvest Quality Control and Sorting

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand quality control and defect removal in processing

---

## 📋 Overview

Post-harvest quality control through sorting separates specialty from commodity - removing defects (quakers, insect damage, foreign matter) and grading by size/density creates clean, consistent lots that command premium prices. Understanding sorting methods explains specialty vs. commodity quality differences and price premiums.

**Why Sorting Matters**:
- **Defect Removal**: Eliminates quality-destroying defects
- **Grading**: Creates uniform lots (size, density, quality)
- **Specialty Grade**: Requires <5 defects per 300g sample
- **Premium**: Quality sorting justifies specialty pricing
- **Reputation**: Consistent quality builds roaster/origin reputation

## 🔬 Sorting Methods

**Floatation** (Density Sorting):
- **Method**: Cherries/beans in water, defects float
- **Removes**: Under-ripe, insect-damaged, low-density defects
- **Timing**: Multiple times (harvest, after pulping, after washing)
- **Effective**: Simple, efficient, removes major defects

**Screen Sizing**:
- **Method**: Sieves with different mesh sizes
- **Separates**: By bean size (AA, AB, Supremo/Excelso, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Uniform roasting (same size roasts evenly)
- **Grading**: Creates size classifications

**Density Table** (Catador):
- **Method**: Vibrating table, beans slide by density
- **Separates**: Dense (quality) from light (defects)
- **Precision**: More precise than floatation
- **Expensive**: Requires equipment investment

**Electronic/Optical Sorting**:
- **Method**: Camera/sensor detects color defects
- **Removes**: Discolored beans, foreign matter
- **Speed**: Very fast, precise
- **Expensive**: High equipment cost
- **Modern**: Increasing adoption in specialty

**Hand Sorting**:
- **Method**: Manual inspection and removal
- **Precision**: Most precise, catches everything
- **Labor**: Very labor-intensive, expensive
- **Specialty**: Final QC for premium lots
- **Quality**: Highest quality when done thoroughly

## 🎯 Defect Types

**Primary Defects** (Serious):
- **Black beans**: Fungal infection, fermentation
- **Sour**: Over-fermentation
- **Severe insect damage**: Coffee berry borer
- **Foreign matter**: Stones, sticks, non-coffee

**Secondary Defects** (Minor but Affect Quality):
- **Quakers**: Underdeveloped beans (don't roast properly)
- **Broken beans**: Processing damage
- **Shells**: Malformed beans
- **Parchment**: Hulling incomplete

## 📝 Summary

Post-harvest sorting removes defects and grades coffee through floatation (density), screen sizing, optical sorting, and hand sorting - creating clean, uniform lots essential for specialty quality. Specialty grade requires <5 defects per 300g through rigorous sorting; commodity accepts higher defect rates. Quality sorting justifies specialty premiums through consistent, clean, defect-free coffee.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Sorting**: Removes defects, grades by size/density
- **Methods**: Floatation, screens, optical, hand sorting
- **Specialty**: <5 defects per 300g (rigorous sorting)
- **Commodity**: Higher defect tolerance
- **Premium**: Quality sorting justifies specialty pricing
