# Post-Harvest Quality Control

## Overview

Quality control during post-harvest processing determines final coffee quality. Systematic QC at each stage prevents defects and ensures specialty standards.

## Critical Control Points

### 1. Harvest Quality

**Selective Picking**:
- Only ripe cherries
- Multiple passes
- Sorting at harvest
- Foundation of quality

**Verification**:
- Visual inspection
- Float test
- Color uniformity
- Defect removal

### 2. Processing Monitoring

**Washed Processing**:
- Fermentation pH and time
- Water cleanliness
- Washing thoroughness
- Defect removal

**Natural Processing**:
- Drying rate
- Turning frequency
- Mold prevention
- Moisture uniformity

### 3. Drying Control

**Moisture Measurement**:
- Target: 10-12%
- Regular testing
- Multiple samples
- Moisture meter essential

**Quality Checks**:
- Visual inspection
- Smell test (fermentation detection)
- No mold
- Even drying

### 4. Milling and Sorting

**Hulling**:
- Parchment removal
- Minimal bean breakage
- Complete removal
- Quality preservation

**Density Sorting**:
- Heavy beans (premium)
- Light beans (lower grade)
- Defect removal
- Grade separation

**Size Screening**:
- Screen size sorting (17+, 16, 15, etc.)
- Peaberry separation
- Uniformity
- Market requirements

**Optical/Electronic Sorting**:
- Remove discolored beans
- Defect detection
- Precision sorting
- High-quality standard

## Cupping for Quality

### Sample Roasting

**Purpose**:
- Evaluate green quality
- Defect detection
- Grade verification
- Purchase decisions

**Protocol**:
- Standard light roast
- Same profile for all samples
- Cupping immediately
- Systematic evaluation

### Defect Identification

**Categories**:
- Primary defects (severe)
- Secondary defects (moderate)
- Quakers
- Impact assessment

**Action**:
- Re-sorting if needed
- Grade adjustment
- Price negotiation
- Rejection if severe

## Grade Classification

### Specialty Grade

**Requirements**:
- 0 primary defects
- ≤5 secondary defects
- No cup faults
- ≥80 SCA score

### Premium Grade

**Requirements**:
- Few defects
- Good cup quality
- 75-79 points typical
- Commercial specialty

### Commercial Grade

**Requirements**:
- Higher defect tolerance
- Basic quality
- Commodity pricing

## Storage QC

### Green Coffee Storage

**Conditions**:
- 60-70°F temperature
- 60-65% humidity
- Dark
- Good air circulation

**Monitoring**:
- Regular inspection
- Moisture checks
- Smell tests (fermentation or mold)
- Rotation (FIFO)

### Shelf Life

**Optimal**: 3-6 months
**Acceptable**: 6-12 months
**Past Prime**: 12+ months (noticeable quality loss)

**Signs of Aging**:
- Faded appearance
- Papery smell
- Dull cup
- Loss of acidity

## Documentation

### Traceability

**Recording**:
- Farm/lot identification
- Processing method
- Dates (harvest, processing, drying)
- Grades and defects
- Cupping scores

**Purpose**:
- Quality verification
- Problem tracing
- Transparency
- Market requirements

## Practical Applications

### For Processors

**Systematic QC**:
- Checklist at each stage
- Regular measurements
- Documentation
- Corrective actions

### For Buyers

**Verification**:
- Request samples
- Cup before commitment
- Visit facilities if possible
- Verify claims

### For Roasters

**Incoming QC**:
- Cup arrival samples
- Verify consistency
- Check for defects
- Accept or reject

## Conclusion

Post-harvest QC:
- Determines final quality
- Multiple control points
- Systematic approach essential
- Documentation critical
- Continuous monitoring needed
