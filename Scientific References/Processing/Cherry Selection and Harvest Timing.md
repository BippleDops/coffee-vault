# 🍒 Cherry Selection and Harvest Timing

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand harvest timing's critical role in quality

---

## 📋 Overview

Cherry selection and harvest timing are quality's foundation - with ripe cherries containing maximum sugars and flavor development while under-ripe/over-ripe cherries create defects and poor flavor. Understanding ripeness indicators and selective harvesting explains specialty vs. commodity quality differences.

**Why Harvest Timing Matters**:
- **Sugar Development**: Ripe = maximum sugars (sweetness)
- **Flavor**: Peak ripeness = optimal flavor development
- **Defects**: Under/over-ripe = quality degradation
- **Processing**: Proper ripeness essential for fermentation
- **Price**: Specialty requires selective picking (ripe only)

**Ripeness Indicators**:
- **Color**: Deep red (or yellow for Yellow Bourbon, etc.)
- **Feel**: Soft, not hard (under-ripe) or mushy (over-ripe)
- **Detachment**: Easy separation from branch (ripe)
- **Brix**: Sugar content measurement (refractometer) - 18-22% ideal

## 🍒 Harvest Methods

**Selective Picking** (Specialty):
- **Method**: Hand-pick only ripe cherries
- **Multiple Passes**: Return every 7-14 days, pick newly ripened
- **Labor-Intensive**: 3-5x more labor than strip-picking
- **Quality**: Maximum quality (only ripe cherries)
- **Cost**: Expensive (labor costs)
- **Specialty**: Required for specialty-grade

**Strip Picking** (Commodity):
- **Method**: Strip entire branches (ripe, under-ripe, over-ripe all together)
- **Single Pass**: Once through farm
- **Fast**: Efficient, low labor
- **Quality**: Mixed ripeness = lower quality
- **Cost**: Cheap
- **Commodity**: Acceptable for commercial/commodity only

**Mechanical** (Large Brazilian Farms):
- **Method**: Machine harvesting (strips all cherries)
- **Terrain**: Only works on flat terrain
- **Sorting**: Requires post-harvest floatation sorting
- **Quality**: Acceptable if sorted well
- **Scale**: Enables large-scale production

## 📝 Summary

Cherry selection (ripe only vs. mixed ripeness) and harvest timing (peak ripeness vs. convenience) are quality's foundation - selective picking of fully ripe cherries (deep color, soft, 18-22% Brix) maximizes sugars and flavor while strip/mechanical harvesting mixes ripeness levels creating lower quality. Specialty requires selective; commodity accepts mixed.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Ripe Cherries**: Maximum quality (sugars, flavor)
- **Selective**: Hand-pick ripe only (specialty standard)
- **Strip**: All ripeness levels (commodity)
- **Quality**: Ripeness selection determines cup quality ceiling
- **Cost**: Selective 3-5x more expensive (labor)
