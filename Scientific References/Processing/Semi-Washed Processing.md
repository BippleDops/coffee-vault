# Semi-Washed Coffee Processing

## Overview

Semi-washed (also called pulped natural or semi-dry) is a hybrid processing method combining elements of washed and natural processing, common in Brazil and creating balanced, sweet coffees.

## The Process

### Steps

1. **Depulping**: Remove cherry skin (like washed)
2. **Skip Fermentation**: No fermentation tank (unlike washed)
3. **Mechanical Mucilage Removal**: Machine removes mucilage (unlike washed fermentation)
4. **Drying**: Dry parchment-covered beans (like washed final step)

### Key Difference from Washed

**Washed**:
- Fermentation removes mucilage
- 12-48 hours in tanks
- Biological process

**Semi-Washed**:
- Mechanical removal
- No fermentation
- Demucilager machine
- Immediate drying

## Equipment

### Demucilager (Critical)

**Function**:
- Mechanical scrubbing
- Removes mucilage layer
- Uses minimal water
- Fast processing

**Types**:
- Penagos (brand name, common)
- Other manufacturers
- Variable efficiency
- Maintenance important

## Flavor Profile

### Characteristics

**Typical**:
- Balanced acidity (more than natural, less than washed)
- Medium to full body
- Clean cup
- Sweet, nutty
- Chocolate, caramel notes

**Brazilian Semi-Washed** (Pulped Natural):
- Nutty, chocolatey
- Heavy body
- Low acidity
- Creamy texture
- Very consistent

## Advantages

**Water Conservation**:
- Minimal water use
- No fermentation tanks
- Environmental benefit
- Lower costs

**Consistency**:
- Mechanical process
- Less variable than fermentation
- Predictable results
- Quality control easier

**Sweetness**:
- Residual sugars
- Some mucilage remains
- Enhanced body
- Balanced profile

## Geographic Use

### Brazil (Primary)

**Dominance**:
- Most Brazilian coffee
- Large-scale application
- Mechanized processing
- Consistent results

**Market**:
- Commercial and specialty
- Reliable supply
- Predictable quality
- Base coffee for blends

### Other Regions

**Limited**:
- Some Central American
- Equipment requirement
- Market preference for other methods
- Niche application

## Practical Applications

### For Producers

**When to Use**:
- Water scarcity
- Want consistency
- Have equipment
- Target balanced profile

### For Roasters

**Versatility**:
- Works at multiple roast levels
- Blend-friendly
- Reliable
- Medium roast shines

### For Consumers

**Characteristics**:
- Balanced, approachable
- Not extreme
- Reliable
- Good daily coffee
