# Wet-Hulled Processing (Giling Basah)

## Overview

Wet-hulling (Giling Basah in Indonesian) is a unique processing method exclusive to Indonesia, creating the distinctive earthy, full-bodied character of Sumatran coffees.

## The Process

### Step 1: Pulping
- Remove cherry skin
- Leave mucilage on beans
- Similar to washed processing initially

### Step 2: Brief Fermentation
- 12-24 hours
- Partial mucilage breakdown
- Less than traditional washed

### Step 3: Partial Drying
- **Critical Step**: Dry to only 30-40% moisture
- Parchment still soft and pliable
- Normally would dry to 10-12%
- Stops earlier deliberately

### Step 4: Wet Hulling
- **Unique**: Remove parchment while beans still wet
- Exposes naked green bean
- Bean is bluish-green color
- Soft, vulnerable

### Step 5: Final Drying
- Dry exposed beans to 10-12% moisture
- Direct sun exposure
- Faster than protected drying
- Creates unique chemistry

## Why This Method?

### Practical Necessity

**Climate Challenges**:
- High humidity (80-90%)
- Frequent rainfall
- Difficult to dry in parchment
- Mold risk if drying delayed

**Economic Pressures**:
- Farmers need quick payment
- Can't wait 2-3 weeks for drying
- Sell to collectors at 30% moisture
- Collectors/mills finish drying

### Regional Development

**Indonesian Innovation**:
- Developed for local conditions
- Spread across archipelago
- Creates regional character
- Market acceptance

## Flavor Impact

### Characteristic Profile

**What It Creates**:
- Earthy, forest floor notes
- Herbal complexity
- Full, syrupy body
- Low acidity
- Savory character

**Chemistry**:
- Direct bean exposure affects lipids
- Different oxidation patterns
- Unique fermentation
- Compound development differs

### Comparison to Other Methods

**vs Washed**:
- Much heavier body
- Less acidity
- Earthy vs clean
- Complex vs transparent

**vs Natural**:
- Different fruit character
- Less fruit-forward
- More earthy/herbal
- Unique profile

**vs Honey**:
- Different sweetness type
- Heavier body
- Less caramel, more earth
- Distinctive not sweet

## Quality Challenges

### Variable Results

**Consistency Issues**:
- Moisture content variation
- Processing inconsistency
- Small-scale processing
- Multiple intermediaries

**Quality Range**:
- Premium: Clean, complex, earthiness balanced
- Commercial: Heavy defects possible, unclean

### Defect Potential

**Common Issues**:
- **Mold**: From high moisture handling
- **Faded beans**: Oxidation during wet hulling
- **Broken beans**: Fragile when wet
- **Ferment**: Over-fermentation during initial stage

## Geographic Distribution

### Sumatra (Primary)

**Regions**:
- Aceh (Gayo)
- North Sumatra (Lintong, Mandheling)
- West Sumatra

**Character**: Classic wet-hulled profile

### Sulawesi

**Toraja Region**:
- Wet-hulled common
- Similar to Sumatran
- Unique variations

### Java and Other Islands

**Mixed Methods**:
- Some wet-hulled
- Some traditional washed
- Variable by region

## Roasting Wet-Hulled Coffee

### Bean Characteristics

**Appearance**:
- Blue-green color (unique)
- Variable moisture (can be 12-15%)
- Often uneven sizing
- May appear damaged

**Density**:
- Variable within batch
- Lower than washed typically
- Affects roast behavior

### Roasting Approach

**Recommendations**:
- Sample roast essential
- Watch for moisture variation
- May roast unevenly
- Medium to dark typical
- Full development appropriate

**Challenges**:
- Bean appearance misleading
- Moisture variation affects consistency
- May need sorting

## Brewing Recommendations

### Ideal Methods

**French Press**:
- Showcases full body
- No filtration of characteristics
- Classic combination

**Espresso**:
- Heavy body for crema
- Low acidity good for milk
- Complex shots

**Cold Brew**:
- Smooth, chocolate-forward
- Very popular application
- Minimizes earthiness

### Parameters

**Temperature**: 88-92°C (lower than African)
**Ratio**: 1:14-1:16 (stronger)
**Grind**: Appropriate for method

## Market Position

### Pricing

**Range**: $12-20/lb typically
**Factors**:
- Grade (1 = highest, minimal defects)
- Region (Gayo premium)
- Processing quality
- Cupping score

### Consumer Reception

**Polarizing**:
- Distinctive character
- Love it or don't
- Not for everyone
- Loyal following

**Market**:
- Established niche
- Predictable demand
- Specialty and commercial overlap

## Quality Indicators
