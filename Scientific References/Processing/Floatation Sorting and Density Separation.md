# 🌊 Floatation Sorting and Density Separation

**Category**: Coffee Processing  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand density sorting for quality improvement

---

## 📋 Overview

Floatation sorting (density separation using water) is coffee processing's simplest quality control - defective, under-ripe, or damaged cherries/beans float while quality coffee sinks, enabling rapid removal of inferior beans and improving final cup quality through basic physics principle.

**How Floatation Works**:
- **Principle**: Density difference (quality sinks, defects float)
- **Water**: Cherries/beans placed in water tanks
- **Separation**: Dense (ripe, quality) sinks; light (defective, under-ripe) floats
- **Removal**: Skim floaters, keep sinkers
- **Simple**: No technology required, just water and gravity

**Why Density Matters**:
- **Ripe = Dense**: Fully developed cherries/beans are denser
- **Under-Ripe = Light**: Underdeveloped cherries float
- **Defective = Light**: Insect damage, empty beans float
- **Quality**: Removing floaters dramatically improves cup quality

## 🔬 What Floats vs. Sinks

**Floaters** (Remove These):
- Under-ripe cherries (green, not fully developed)
- Over-ripe cherries (dried out, air pockets)
- Insect-damaged beans (eaten interior, hollow)
- Defective beans (quakers, sour beans, diseased)
- Foreign matter (sticks, leaves, debris)

**Sinkers** (Keep These):
- Fully ripe cherries (optimal density)
- Quality beans (dense, well-developed)
- No defects (solid, healthy beans)

**Result**: Removing floaters = 10-30% quality improvement instantly

## 🌊 Application Points

**During Depulping** (Cherry Stage):
- **Reception Tank**: Cherries dumped into water
- **First Sort**: Floaters removed before processing
- **Quick**: Immediate defect removal

**After Fermentation** (Parchment Stage):
- **Washing Channels**: Parchment floats/sinks during washing
- **Second Sort**: Remove remaining light beans

**Dry Mill** (Green Bean):
- **Final Sort**: Catador machine (gravity separator) for precise density grading
- **Professional**: Commercial density separation

## 📝 Summary

Floatation sorting removes defective, under-ripe, and damaged coffee through density separation - quality beans sink (dense, well-developed) while defects float (light, hollow, underdeveloped). Applied at multiple processing stages (cherry reception, washing, dry milling), floatation provides simple, effective quality improvement through basic physics.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Principle**: Density difference separates quality from defects
- **Floaters**: Under-ripe, defective, damaged (remove)
- **Sinkers**: Ripe, quality beans (keep)
- **Application**: Multiple stages (cherry, parchment, green bean)
- **Impact**: 10-30% quality improvement from defect removal
