# 🌊 Channel Prevention and Even Extraction

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Prevent channeling, achieve uniform extraction

---

## 📋 Overview

Channeling (water finding paths of least resistance, bypassing coffee) destroys extraction uniformity - creating simultaneous under and over-extraction that makes balanced coffee impossible. Understanding channeling causes and prevention techniques enables even extraction and consistent, quality results.

**What is Channeling**:
- **Definition**: Water flows through weak spots, bypassing coffee
- **Result**: Under-extracted (bypassed areas) + over-extracted (channeled paths)
- **Problem**: Impossible to balance (bitter AND sour simultaneously)
- **Common**: Espresso especially (pressure amplifies), pour-over too

**Why Channeling Happens**:
- **Uneven Density**: Clumps, gaps in coffee bed
- **Poor Distribution**: Grounds not evenly distributed
- **Fines Migration**: Fine particles clog, create channels
- **Puck Damage**: Disrupted coffee bed (tamping issues, uneven)

## 🎯 Prevention Techniques

**Espresso**:
- **WDT** (Weiss Distribution Technique): Needle tool breaks clumps
- **Even Distribution**: Level coffee in portafilter
- **Level Tamping**: Flat, even tamp (no angles)
- **Puck Screen**: Prevents top channeling
- **Fresh Coffee**: Degassed coffee distributes better

**Pour-Over**:
- **Flat Bed**: Level grounds before brewing
- **Gentle Pouring**: No aggressive pours disturbing bed
- **Spiral Pattern**: Distributes water evenly
- **Even Saturation**: Bloom ensures uniform wetting

## 📝 Summary

Channeling (water bypassing coffee through weak spots) creates uneven extraction - prevented through even distribution (WDT for espresso, flat bed for pour-over), level tamping/pouring, and fresh coffee. Eliminating channeling enables uniform extraction and balanced, quality coffee.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Channeling**: Water bypass, uneven extraction
- **Prevention**: Even distribution, level technique
- **WDT**: Essential for espresso (breaks clumps)
- **Flat Bed**: Critical for pour-over
- **Fresh Coffee**: Degassed coffee distributes better
