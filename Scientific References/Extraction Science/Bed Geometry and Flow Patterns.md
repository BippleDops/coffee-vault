# 📐 Bed Geometry and Flow Patterns

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand how coffee bed shape affects extraction

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee bed geometry (flat vs. conical) affects water flow patterns and extraction uniformity - flat beds (Kalita Wave) create even flow and forgiving extraction while conical beds (V60) create faster center flow requiring technique to prevent channeling. Understanding geometry effects enables optimal brewer selection and technique adaptation.

**Two Main Geometries**:
1. **Flat Bed** (Kalita Wave, Clever): Water flows evenly through flat coffee layer
2. **Conical** (V60, Chemex): Water flows faster through center, slower at edges

**Why Geometry Matters**:
- **Flow Pattern**: Determines water path through coffee
- **Extraction Evenness**: Affects uniform vs. variable extraction
- **Technique Sensitivity**: Some geometries more forgiving
- **Brew Time**: Geometry affects total brew time

## 📐 Flat Bed (Kalita Wave)

**Characteristics**:
- **Shape**: Flat horizontal coffee layer
- **Holes**: Multiple small holes, even distribution
- **Flow**: Uniform across entire bed
- **Even**: All coffee extracts similarly

**Advantages**:
- **Forgiving**: Less technique-dependent
- **Consistent**: Repeatable results easier
- **Even Extraction**: Natural flow uniformity

**Result**: Balanced, consistent, forgiving brewing

## 🔺 Conical Bed (V60)

**Characteristics**:
- **Shape**: Cone, single large hole at bottom
- **Flow**: Faster through center, slower at edges
- **Technique**: Requires pouring skill for evenness

**Advantages**:
- **Clarity**: Can achieve highest clarity (when done well)
- **Control**: Advanced technique enables optimization
- **Ceiling**: Highest quality ceiling with skill

**Challenges**:
- **Channeling**: Center flow faster (can channel)
- **Technique**: Requires skill for even extraction

## 📝 Summary

Bed geometry affects extraction uniformity - flat beds (Kalita) create even flow and forgiving, consistent extraction through multiple holes and horizontal coffee layer; conical beds (V60) flow faster through center requiring technique to prevent channeling but enabling highest clarity with skill. Choosing geometry is choosing forgiveness (flat) vs. control/ceiling (conical).

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Flat Bed**: Even flow, forgiving, consistent (Kalita)
- **Conical**: Center-dominant flow, technique-sensitive, high ceiling (V60)
- **Forgiveness**: Flat more forgiving
- **Ceiling**: Conical higher quality ceiling with skill
