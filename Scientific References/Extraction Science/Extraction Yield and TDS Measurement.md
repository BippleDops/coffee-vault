# 🔬 Extraction Yield and TDS Measurement Guide

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Basic brewing knowledge, understanding of ratios  
**Learning Objectives**: Measure extraction yield, use refractometer, optimize brewing scientifically

---

## 📋 Overview

Extraction yield and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the fundamental measurements that transform coffee brewing from art to science, enabling precise, repeatable, optimized results. By measuring what percentage of coffee dissolved into water (extraction yield) and how concentrated the result is (TDS), brewers can diagnose problems, optimize recipes, and achieve consistent excellence.

**Why Measurement Matters**:
- **Precision**: Replace guessing with data
- **Consistency**: Repeat excellent results reliably
- **Optimization**: Target ideal extraction zone scientifically
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose sour (under-extraction) vs. bitter (over-extraction)
- **Communication**: Share recipes precisely (TDS + extraction yield)
- **Competition**: Professional standard for barista/brewers competitions
- **Understanding**: Learn how variables affect extraction

## 🔬 Key Concepts

### TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)

**Definition**: Concentration of dissolved coffee solids in brewed coffee

**Measurement**: Percentage (%) or mg/L
- **Example**: 1.35% TDS = 13,500 mg/L = 1.35 grams of coffee solids per 100ml liquid

**Typical Ranges**:
- **Filter Coffee (Drip, Pour-Over)**: 1.15-1.55% TDS
  - **Weak**: <1.15%
  - **Ideal**: 1.30-1.45%
  - **Strong**: >1.55%
- **Immersion (French Press, Clever)**: 1.30-1.55% TDS
- **Espresso**: 7-12% TDS (much higher concentration)
- **Cold Brew**: 1.0-2.0% TDS (diluted concentrate)

**What TDS Tells You**:
- **Brew Strength**: How concentrated the coffee is
- **NOT Quality**: High TDS ≠ good coffee (can be over-extracted and strong)
- **Preference**: Personal preference for strength (no universal ideal)

### Extraction Yield

**Definition**: Percentage of ground coffee that dissolved into water

**Formula**:  
**Extraction % = (Brewed Coffee Weight × TDS %) / Dry Coffee Dose × 100**

**Example Calculation**:
- Coffee dose: 20g
- Water: 320g
- TDS: 1.35%
- Brewed coffee collected: 300g (after absorption)
- **Extraction = (300g × 1.35%) / 20g = 20.25%**

**Optimal Ranges (SCA Guidelines)**:
- **Under-Extracted**: <18% (sour, weak, thin, underdeveloped)
- **Ideal Zone**: **18-22%** (balanced, sweet, pleasant)
- **Over-Extracted**: >22% (bitter, harsh, astringent)

**More Nuanced Reality**:
- **Light Roasts**: Can go 20-23% (high extraction works)
- **Dark Roasts**: Best at 18-20% (avoid bitterness)
- **Espresso**: 18-22% same (despite higher TDS)
- **Personal Preference**: Some prefer 17-19%, others 20-23%

## 📐 The Brewing Control Chart

**SCA Brewing Control Chart**: Maps TDS (strength) vs. Extraction Yield (quality)

**Four Quadrants**:

1. **Weak & Under-Extracted** (Low TDS, Low Extraction):
   - **Flavor**: Sour, thin, watery, underdeveloped
   - **Cause**: Too coarse grind, too little coffee, too fast brewing
   - **Fix**: Grind finer, use more coffee, brew longer

2. **Weak & Over-Extracted** (Low TDS, High Extraction):
   - **Flavor**: Bitter but weak, hollow, harsh
   - **Cause**: Too much water for coffee, too fine grind
   - **Fix**: Use more coffee OR grind slightly coarser

3. **Strong & Under-Extracted** (High TDS, Low Extraction):
   - **Flavor**: Sour but intense, concentrated sourness
   - **Cause**: Too much coffee, too coarse grind, not enough time
   - **Fix**: Grind finer OR reduce coffee dose

4. **Strong & Over-Extracted** (High TDS, High Extraction):
   - **Flavor**: Bitter, harsh, astringent, too strong
   - **Cause**: Too much coffee, too fine grind, too long
   - **Fix**: Grind coarser, reduce coffee, shorter time

**Ideal Zone** (Center):
- **TDS**: 1.30-1.45%
- **Extraction**: 19-21%
- **Flavor**: Balanced, sweet, complex, pleasant

## 🔬 Measuring TDS with Refractometer

### Equipment

**Refractometer**: Device that measures TDS by light refraction

**Types**:
1. **VST LAB Coffee**: $600-900 (professional standard, accurate)
2. **DiFluid R2 Extract**: $150-250 (affordable, good accuracy)
3. **Atago PAL**: $400-600 (good, Japanese precision)
4. **Hanna Instruments**: $80-120 (budget option, less accurate)

**How Refractometers Work**:
- **Principle**: Dissolved solids bend light (refraction)
- **Measurement**: Degree of refraction indicates concentration
- **Output**: TDS percentage
- **Accuracy**: ±0.01-0.05% depending on model

### Using a Refractometer

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Brew Coffee**: Normal brew method, controlled recipe
2. **Collect Sample**: 
   - Pour-Over: Collect entire brew
   - French Press: Stir, let settle, sample from middle
   - Espresso: Entire shot
3. **Cool Sample**: Room temperature (critical - hot coffee = inaccurate)
   - Wait 10-15 minutes OR
   - Use metal spoon to cool faster
   - **Target**: 68-72°F (20-22°C)
4. **Sample Refractometer**:
   - Place 2-3 drops on measurement surface
   - Close cover
   - Read TDS percentage
5. **Clean**: Rinse with distilled water, dry with soft cloth
6. **Record**: Note TDS for calculation

**Tips**:
- **Room Temperature Critical**: Hot samples = inaccurate (10-20% error)
- **Homogenize**: Stir brewed coffee before sampling (espresso especially)
- **Multiple Readings**: Average 2-3 readings for accuracy
- **Calibrate**: Calibrate monthly with distilled water (should read 0.00%)
- **Clean**: Residue affects readings - clean between samples

## 🧮 Calculating Extraction Yield

**Formula**:  
**Extraction % = (Brewed Coffee Weight × TDS%) / Dry Coffee Dose**

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Weigh Dry Coffee**: e.g., 20.0g
2. **Weigh Water Used**: e.g., 320g
3. **Brew Coffee**: Using your method
4. **Weigh Brewed Coffee Collected**: e.g., 295g (25g absorbed by grounds)
5. **Measure TDS**: e.g., 1.35%
6. **Calculate**: (295g × 1.35%) / 20g = **19.9% extraction**

**Interpretation**:
- 19.9% = Within ideal zone (18-22%)
- Balanced extraction likely
- If tastes good, recipe is dialed in

**Adjusting**:
- **If <18% and tastes sour**: Grind finer, increase temp, brew longer
- **If >22% and tastes bitter**: Grind coarser, lower temp, brew shorter
- **If within range but tastes off**: Adjust TDS (strength) via ratio

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### Dialing In Espresso

**Target**:
- **TDS**: 8-10% (concentrated)
- **Extraction**: 19-21% (same as filter coffee)

**Example**:
- Dose: 18g
- Yield: 36g out
- TDS: 9.5%
- Extraction: (36g × 9.5%) / 18g = **19%** ✅

**Adjustments**:
- Under-extracted (sour): Grind finer
- Over-extracted (bitter): Grind coarser
- Too strong: Longer ratio (40-45g out)
- Too weak: Shorter ratio (32-34g out)

### Dialing In Pour-Over

**Target**:
- **TDS**: 1.30-1.45%
- **Extraction**: 19-21%

**Example**:
- Dose: 20g
- Water: 320g
- Brewed weight: 298g
- TDS: 1.38%
- Extraction: (298 × 1.38%) / 20g = **20.5%** ✅ Perfect
