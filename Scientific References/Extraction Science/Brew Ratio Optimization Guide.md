# ⚖️ Brew Ratio Optimization

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Optimize coffee-to-water ratio for desired strength

---

## 📋 Overview

Brew ratio (coffee-to-water ratio) determines final brew strength - affecting TDS, flavor intensity, and overall cup character. Understanding ratio optimization enables precise strength control independent of extraction quality.

**Standard Ratios by Method**:
- **Espresso**: 1:2 (18g → 36g)
- **Pour-Over**: 1:15-1:17 (20g → 300-340g)
- **French Press**: 1:15 (30g → 450g)
- **Cold Brew Concentrate**: 1:4-1:8

**Why Ratio Matters**:
- **Strength**: Determines TDS (concentration)
- **Independent**: Can adjust strength without affecting extraction %
- **Preference**: Personal taste drives ratio choice
- **Optimization**: Match ratio to coffee and preference

## 🎯 Ratio Adjustment

**Stronger** (More Coffee, Less Water):
- 1:14, 1:13 ratios
- **Higher TDS**: More concentrated
- **Use**: Strong coffee preference, robust flavors

**Standard** (Balanced):
- 1:15-1:16 ratios
- **Balanced TDS**: ~1.30-1.45%
- **Use**: Most coffees, versatile

**Weaker** (Less Coffee, More Water):
- 1:17, 1:18 ratios
- **Lower TDS**: More dilute
- **Use**: Gentle preference, delicate coffees

---

## 📝 Summary

Brew ratio determines strength (TDS) independent of extraction quality - standard ratios (1:15-1:17 pour-over, 1:2 espresso) create balanced strength; adjust stronger (more coffee) or weaker (less coffee) based on preference and coffee characteristics.
