# 💧 Percolation Models and Flow Rate

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand percolation dynamics in pour-over brewing

---

## 📋 Overview

Percolation (water flowing through coffee bed) governs pour-over extraction - with flow rate, bed depth, and grind size determining contact time and extraction yield. Understanding percolation models explains draw-down time targets, grind adjustments, and brew time optimization.

**Percolation vs. Immersion**:
- **Percolation**: Water flows through coffee (V60, Chemex, drip)
- **Immersion**: Water and coffee fully mixed (French Press, Clever)
- **Hybrid**: Both (Clever Dripper, some AeroPress recipes)

**Why Percolation Matters**:
- **Contact Time**: Flow rate determines water-coffee contact duration
- **Extraction**: Slower flow = more extraction (up to point)
- **Optimization**: Target flow rates enable consistent results

## 🔬 Flow Rate Factors

**Grind Size** (Primary):
- **Finer**: Slower flow (more resistance)
- **Coarser**: Faster flow (less resistance)
- **Control**: Main variable for adjusting flow

**Bed Depth**:
- **Deeper**: Slower flow (more coffee to pass through)
- **Shallow**: Faster flow

**Filter Type**:
- **Paper**: Slower (fine pores)
- **Metal**: Faster (larger pores)

## ⏱️ Target Flow Times

**Pour-Over** (V60, Kalita):
- **Target**: 2:45-3:30 total time
- **Too Fast** (<2:30): Under-extraction likely, grind finer
- **Too Slow** (>4:00): Over-extraction or clogged, grind coarser

**Optimal**: ~3:00 finish time for balanced extraction

## 📝 Summary

Percolation (water flow through coffee bed) determines pour-over contact time and extraction - controlled primarily through grind size (finer = slower flow, coarser = faster). Target draw-down times (2:45-3:30 for pour-over) ensure adequate extraction; too fast (<2:30) suggests under-extraction, too slow (>4:00) suggests over-extraction or clogging.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Percolation**: Water flowing through coffee bed
- **Flow Rate**: Determines contact time, affects extraction
- **Grind Control**: Primary variable (finer = slower)
- **Target**: ~3:00 total time for pour-over
- **Adjust**: Grind size modifies flow rate
