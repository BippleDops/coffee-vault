# Coffee Brewing Control Chart

**The Foundation of Modern Coffee Brewing Science**

The Coffee Brewing Control Chart is the most important tool for understanding and optimizing coffee extraction. Developed by MIT chemical engineer Dr. Ernest E. Lockhart in the 1950s and refined by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), it maps the relationship between brew strength and extraction yield to define ideal brewing zones.

---

## 📊 What Is the Brewing Control Chart?

### Definition

The Brewing Control Chart is a two-dimensional graph that plots:
- **X-axis**: Extraction Yield (percentage of coffee solubles extracted)
- **Y-axis**: Brew Strength (Total Dissolved Solids - TDS percentage)

It divides coffee brewing into distinct quality zones based on these measurements.

### Historical Context

**1950s - Dr. Ernest E. Lockhart (MIT)**:
- Conducted systematic research on coffee brewing
- Established relationship between strength and extraction
- Defined "ideal" brewing parameters
- Created first brewing control chart

**1960s - Coffee Brewing Institute**:
- Refined Lockhart's work
- Established industry standards
- Created standardized testing protocols

**2000s - SCA (Specialty Coffee Association)**:
- Updated chart for specialty coffee
- Refined ideal zones based on modern preferences
- Created digital tools and calculators

## 🎯 The Ideal Brewing Zone

### SCA Recommended Ranges

**Extraction Yield**: 18% - 22%
- Below 18%: Under-extracted
- 18-22%: Ideal range
- Above 22%: Over-extracted

**Brew Strength (TDS)**: 1.15% - 1.35%
- Below 1.15%: Weak/watery
- 1.15-1.35%: Ideal strength
- Above 1.35%: Strong/concentrated

### The Golden Cup Standard

The intersection of ideal extraction and strength is called "Golden Cup":
- **Extraction**: 18-22%
- **TDS**: 1.15-1.35%
- **Brew Ratio**: Typically 1:15 to 1:17 (coffee:water)

**Why These Numbers?**:
- Based on extensive sensory analysis
- Optimizes flavor balance
- Minimizes bitterness and sourness
- Maximizes sweetness and complexity

## 📐 Understanding the Chart Zones

### Zone 1: Underdeveloped (Low Extraction, Low Strength)
**Characteristics**: Weak, sour, thin
**Cause**: Too little coffee, too little extraction
**Fix**: Increase dose or extraction time

### Zone 2: Weak (Ideal Extraction, Low Strength)
**Characteristics**: Balanced flavors but watery
**Cause**: Not enough coffee for water volume
**Fix**: Increase coffee dose or reduce water

### Zone 3: Strong (Ideal Extraction, High Strength)
**Characteristics**: Intense, concentrated, balanced
**Cause**: High coffee-to-water ratio
**Fix**: Acceptable for some preferences, dilute if needed

### Zone 4: Underdeveloped Strong (Low Extraction, High Strength)
**Characteristics**: Sour, intense, unbalanced
**Cause**: Too much coffee but under-extracted
**Fix**: Grind finer, increase brew time, or increase temperature

### Zone 5: Ideal (18-22% Extraction, 1.15-1.35% TDS)
**Characteristics**: Balanced, sweet, complex, pleasant
**Cause**: Optimal parameters
**Fix**: None - this is the target

### Zone 6: Overdeveloped Weak (High Extraction, Low Strength)
**Characteristics**: Bitter, astringent, hollow
**Cause**: Over-extracted with insufficient coffee
**Fix**: Grind coarser, reduce brew time, use more coffee

### Zone 7: Overdeveloped (High Extraction, Ideal Strength)
**Characteristics**: Bitter but full-bodied
**Cause**: Over-extraction at normal ratio
**Fix**: Grind coarser, reduce temperature, or shorten brew time

### Zone 8: Overdeveloped Strong (High Extraction, High Strength)
**Characteristics**: Very bitter, astringent, harsh
**Cause**: Too much coffee over-extracted
**Fix**: Grind coarser, reduce brew time, or reduce dose

## 🧮 Mathematical Relationships

### Extraction Yield Formula

$$\text{Extraction Yield (\%)} = \frac{\text{TDS (\%)} \times \text{Beverage Weight (g)}}{\text{Coffee Dose (g)}} \times 100$$

**Example Calculation**:
- Coffee Dose: 20g
- Water: 300g
- Final Beverage Weight: 280g (20g absorbed by grounds)
- Measured TDS: 1.25%

$$\text{Extraction} = \frac{1.25 \times 280}{20} \times 100 = 17.5\%$$

This is slightly under-extracted (target 18-22%).

### Brew Strength (TDS)

$$\text{TDS (\%)} = \frac{\text{Mass of Dissolved Solids (g)}}{\text{Total Beverage Mass (g)}} \times 100$$

**Measured directly with a refractometer**, which correlates refractive index to dissolved solids concentration.

### Brew Ratio

$$\text{Brew Ratio} = \frac{\text{Water Mass (g)}}{\text{Coffee Mass (g)}}$$

Expressed as 1:X ratio (e.g., 1:16 means 16g water per 1g coffee).

### Relationship Between Variables

$$\text{TDS} = \frac{\text{Extraction Yield} \times \text{Coffee Dose}}{\text{Beverage Weight}}$$

This shows that:
- Higher extraction → higher TDS (if ratio constant)
- More coffee → higher TDS (if extraction constant)
- Less water → higher TDS (if dose constant)

## 🔬 Measuring Tools & Techniques

### TDS Refractometer

**How It Works**:
1. Light passes through coffee sample
2. Dissolved solids bend (refract) light
3. Sensor measures refraction angle
4. Converts to TDS percentage

**Popular Models**:
- **VST LAB Coffee III**: Industry standard ($700)
- **Atago PAL-COFFEE**: Portable option ($500)
- **DiFluid R2 Extract**: Budget digital option ($150)

**Usage Tips**:
- Sample must be at room temperature
- Stir sample thoroughly before measuring
- Clean sensor between measurements
- Calibrate regularly with distilled water

### Digital Scales

**Required Precision**: ±0.1g minimum
- Dose measurement critical
- Beverage weight affects calculation
- Water absorption varies by brew method

### Calculating Without a Refractometer

**Approximation Method**:
- Use known brew ratios
- Assume ~20% extraction for well-dialed brewing
- Calculate expected TDS
- Adjust based on taste

**Common Ratios and Expected TDS**:
- 1:15 ratio → ~1.40% TDS (strong)
- 1:16 ratio → ~1.30% TDS (ideal)
- 1:17 ratio → ~1.20% TDS (ideal)
- 1:18 ratio → ~1.15% TDS (balanced)

- Temperature affects solubility of compounds

### Turbulence/Agitation
**Effect**: Affects extraction rate and evenness
- More agitation → Faster extraction
- Less agitation → Slower extraction
- Even extraction requires good turbulence

### Water Chemistry
**Effect**: Affects extraction capacity
- Harder water → Better extraction (to a point)
- Soft water → Lower extraction
- Alkalinity affects acid extraction

## 🎓 Practical Applications

### Dialing In Espresso

**Starting Point**: 1:2 ratio (e.g., 18g in, 36g out)
**Target TDS**: 8-12% (much higher than filter)
**Target Extraction**: 18-22%

**Adjustment Strategy**:
1. Taste the shot
2. Measure TDS if possible
3. Adjust grind for extraction (horizontal)
4. Adjust ratio for strength (vertical)

**Example**:
- Shot tastes sour → Under-extracted → Grind finer
- Shot tastes weak → Low strength → Increase dose or reduce output
- Shot tastes bitter → Over-extracted → Grind coarser
- Shot tastes strong but balanced → Good extraction, high strength → Acceptable or increase output

### Dialing In Pour Over

**Starting Point**: 1:16 ratio (e.g., 20g coffee, 320g water)
**Target TDS**: 1.15-1.35%
**Target Extraction**: 18-22%

**Adjustment Strategy**:
1. Brew and measure TDS
2. Calculate extraction yield
3. Plot on brewing control chart
4. Adjust single variable at a time

**Example Troubleshooting**:
- **TDS 1.10%, Extraction 17%** (Weak/Under)
  - Increase dose to 22g (raises TDS)
  - Grind finer (raises extraction)

- **TDS 1.50%, Extraction 23%** (Strong/Over)
  - Decrease dose to 18g (lowers TDS)
  - Grind coarser (lowers extraction)

### Batch Brewing

**Commercial Standards**: SCA Golden Cup
**Typical Ratio**: 1:16 to 1:17
**Target**: Center of ideal zone

**Consistency Factors**:
- Pre-weighed doses
- Consistent grind
- Water temperature control
