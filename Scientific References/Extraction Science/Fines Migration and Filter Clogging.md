# 🔬 Fines Migration and Filter Clogging

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand fines behavior and prevent clogging

---

## 📋 Overview

Fines migration (fine particles moving to filter and clogging) affects extraction rate and quality - creating slower draw-down in pour-over and channeling in espresso. Understanding fines behavior enables prevention through grinder quality, technique, and brew method selection.

**What is Fines Migration**:
- **Fines**: Ultra-fine particles (<100 microns)
- **Migration**: Fines move downward, accumulate at filter
- **Clogging**: Accumulated fines block water flow
- **Result**: Slower extraction, over-extraction of fines, uneven overall

**Why It Matters**:
- **Pour-Over**: Slow draw-down (>4 minutes), muddy cup
- **Espresso**: Channeling, uneven extraction
- **Consistency**: Variable results from fines behavior

## 🔬 How Migration Occurs

**Gravity + Water Flow**:
- **Downward Movement**: Fines sink through larger particles
- **Water Push**: Flow carries fines toward filter
- **Accumulation**: Fines concentrate at bottom/filter
- **Clog**: Dense fines layer blocks flow

## 🛡️ Prevention

**Better Grinder**:
- **Fewer Fines**: Quality grinder produces less fines
- **Best Solution**: Upgrade grinder (most effective)

**Gentle Pouring**:
- **No Agitation**: Aggressive pours accelerate migration
- **Gentle**: Minimizes fines movement

**Coarser Grind**:
- **Trade-Off**: Fewer total fines but may under-extract
- **Balance**: Find optimal grind for coffee

## 📝 Summary

Fines migration (fine particles moving to filter and clogging) slows extraction and creates uneven brewing - prevented through better grinders (fewer fines produced), gentle pouring technique (minimizes movement), and appropriate grind size. Fines migration explains slow draw-down and extraction inconsistency.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Fines Migration**: Ultra-fine particles sink to filter
- **Clogging**: Accumulated fines block flow
- **Prevention**: Better grinder (fewer fines), gentle technique
- **Impact**: Slow draw-down, uneven extraction
