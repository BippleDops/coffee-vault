# 🌡️ Temperature Effects on Extraction Rate

**Category**: Extraction Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand temperature's profound effect on extraction

---

## 📋 Overview

Water temperature is extraction's master variable - controlling dissolution rate, diffusion speed, and compound solubility, with higher temperatures extracting faster and more completely while lower temperatures create gentler, selective extraction. Understanding temperature effects enables precise brew optimization for desired flavor profiles.

**Why Temperature Matters**:
- **Extraction Rate**: Hotter = faster extraction (exponential relationship)
- **Solubility**: Higher temp = more compounds soluble
- **Compound Selection**: Temperature affects which compounds extract
- **Flavor Balance**: Temp determines extraction balance
- **Optimization**: Most powerful brewing variable after grind size

**Temperature Range**:
- **Cold** (Room temp-40°F): Minimal extraction (cold brew over hours)
- **Warm** (140-180°F): Slow extraction, selective
- **Hot** (195-205°F): Optimal extraction, balanced
- **Boiling** (212°F): Maximum extraction, harshness risk

## 🔬 Temperature-Extraction Relationship

**Chemical Kinetics**:
- **10°C Increase**: Doubles reaction rate (approximation)
- **195°F vs. 205°F**: ~30% faster extraction
- **Exponential**: Temperature effect is exponential, not linear

**Compound Solubility by Temperature**:
- **Acids**: Soluble at all temps (extract even cold)
- **Sugars**: More soluble hot
- **Bitters**: Most soluble hot (why cold brew smooth)
- **Oils**: Released more at high temp

## ☕ Temperature Recommendations

**Light Roasts** (Ethiopian, Kenyan, Bright):
- **200-205°F** (93-96°C): Hot water needed for full extraction
- **Why**: Complex compounds need heat to extract

**Medium Roasts** (Colombian, Guatemalan, Balanced):
- **195-203°F** (91-95°C): Standard range, versatile
- **Why**: Balanced extraction, moderate temp

**Dark Roasts** (Brazilian, Indonesian, Low-Acid):
- **185-198°F** (85-92°C): Cooler to avoid bitterness
- **Why**: Extract easily, prevent over-extraction

## 📝 Summary

Water temperature exponentially affects extraction rate - with 10°C increase approximately doubling extraction speed, making temperature coffee's most powerful brewing variable after grind size. Optimal brewing temperatures (195-205°F) balance extraction speed and compound solubility; cooler temps for dark roasts (avoid bitterness), hotter for light roasts (ensure full extraction).

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Exponential**: 10°C increase ~doubles extraction rate
- **Optimal**: 195-205°F for most coffee
- **Light Roasts**: 200-205°F (need heat for complexity)
- **Dark Roasts**: 185-198°F (prevent over-extraction)
- **Master Variable**: Second only to grind size in importance
