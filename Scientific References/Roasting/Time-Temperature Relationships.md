# Time-Temperature Relationships in Roasting

## Overview

The relationship between time and temperature during roasting determines coffee flavor development. Understanding these dynamics enables precise roast control and consistent quality.

## Fundamental Relationship

### The Curve

**Temperature Over Time**:
- Not linear
- Multiple phases
- Inflection points
- Complex dynamics

**Rate of Change**:
- Varies throughout roast
- Rate of Rise (ROR) metric
- Declining trend typical
- Critical control parameter

## Heat Transfer Phases

### Endothermic Periods

**Moisture Evaporation**:
- 100-160°C
- Water vaporization requires energy
- Temperature rise slows
- "Heat soak" period

**First Crack**:
- ~196°C
- Endothermic event
- Temperature plateau possible
- Energy absorbed

### Exothermic Periods

**After First Crack**:
- 200-230°C+
- Reactions release heat
- Temperature accelerates
- Can runaway
- Careful control needed

## Temperature Zones

### Green to Yellow (0-165°C)

**Duration**: 4-7 minutes
**Goal**: Uniform drying

**Chemistry**:
- Water evaporation
- Minimal reactions
- Grassy aromas released
- Preparation phase

**Control**:
- Steady heat application
- Monitor moisture release
- Don't rush
- Foundation for quality

### Maillard Zone (165-196°C)

**Duration**: 3-6 minutes
**Goal**: Flavor development

**Chemistry**:
- Maillard reactions peak
- Browning compounds
- Aroma formation
- Flavor complexity

**Control**:
- Critical control period
- ROR management
- Heat modulation
- Prevents baking or rushing

### Development Zone (196°C → Drop)

**Duration**: 1.5-4 minutes
**Goal**: Final roast level

**Chemistry**:
- Caramelization active
- Pyrolysis beginning
- Continued complexity
- Color development

**Control**:
- Often reduce heat
- Manage exothermic
- Hit target without overshoot
- Precision critical

## Time Considerations

### Total Roast Time

**Fast Roasts** (8-11 minutes):
- Higher heat throughout
- Brighter acidity
- Less body development
- Riskier for consistency
- More origin character

**Moderate** (11-15 minutes):
- Balanced development
- Standard approach
- Consistent results
- Versatile

**Slow** (15-18+ minutes):
- Lower heat
- More body
- Risk of baking
- Can taste flat

### Development Time

**After First Crack**:
- 1.5-4 minutes typical
- Light roast: 1.5-2.5 min
- Medium: 2.5-3.5 min
- Dark: 3.5-4+ min

**Development Time Ratio**:
```
DTR = Development Time / Total Time × 100
```
- Target: 15-25%
- Below 15%: Likely underdeveloped
- Above 25%: May be overdeveloped

## Temperature Control Strategies

### Declining ROR Profile

**Standard Approach**:
- ROR declines throughout
- Smooth, continuous decline
- No crashes or spikes
- Most common commercial

**Benefits**:
- Predictable
- Consistent
- Well-understood
- Reliable

### Increasing ROR ("Flicking")

**Advanced Technique**:
- ROR increases at points
- Controlled heat additions
- More complex
- Risk of scorching

**When Used**:
- Specific flavor goals
- High-density beans
- Advanced roasters
- Experimental profiles

### Flat ROR Periods

**Intentional**:
- Maintain temperature rise rate
- Extended Maillard
- Body development
- Specific applications

**Unintentional** (Baking):
- Temperature stalls
- Development stops
- Flat flavors result
- Quality defect

## Bean Density Effects

### High-Density Beans

**Characteristics**:
- High altitude
- Slow maturation
- Dense cellular structure
- More energy needed

**Profile Adjustments**:
- Higher charge temperature
- More aggressive heat
- Longer total time
- Can handle intensity
- Higher drop temperature

**Examples**: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Kenyan AA

### Low-Density Beans

**Characteristics**:
- Lower altitude
- Faster maturation
- Less dense structure
- Heat penetrates faster

**Profile Adjustments**:
- Lower charge temperature
- Gentler heat application
- Shorter total time
- Risk of scorching
- Lower drop temperature

**Examples**: Brazilian, some Indonesian

## Moisture Content Impact

### High-Moisture Beans (11-12%)

**Fresh Crop**:
- More energy for drying
- Extended drying phase
- Longer total time needed
- More ROR decline initially

**Profile**:
- Allow time for drying
- Don't rush early phase
- Adjust total time +10-15%

### Low-Moisture Beans (9-10%)

**Aged Crop**:
- Less drying needed
- Shorter drying phase
- Faster to first crack
- Different development

**Profile**:
- Reduce charge temperature
- Less time overall
- Watch for scorching
- Adjust time -10-15%

## Environmental Factors

### Ambient Temperature

**Cold Weather**:
- Higher heat loss
- Need more heat input
- Longer roast times
- Charge temp may need increase

**Hot Weather**:
- Less heat loss
- May need less heat
- Faster roasts possible
- Charge temp may decrease

### Humidity

**High Humidity**:
- Beans may absorb moisture
- Affects drying phase
- Can extend time needed

**Low Humidity**:
- Drier beans
- Faster drying
- Slight time reduction

### Barometric Pressure

**Altitude Effects**:
- Higher altitude = lower pressure
- Water boils at lower temperature
- Affects heat transfer
- Profile adjustments needed

## Profile Documentation

### Essential Data

**Record**:
- Date and time
- Bean origin/variety
- Batch size
- Charge temperature
- All temperature readings (every 30 seconds)
- Heat setting changes
- Airflow adjustments
- Crack times
- Drop temperature
- Weight loss %
- Roast time

### Cupping Correlation

**Link Sensory to Profile**:
- Cup each batch
- Score systematically
- Note defects
- Correlate to profile data
- Build knowledge

## Profile Adjustment Strategies

### Too Sour/Acidic

**Issue**: Underdevelopment

**Fixes**:
- Increase development time
- Higher drop temperature
- Slower drying phase
- More time in Maillard

### Too Bitter

**Issue**: Over-roasting

**Fixes**:
