# Batch Size and Roast Consistency

## Overview

Batch size significantly affects roasting behavior and consistency. Understanding these relationships enables optimal roasting and troubleshooting.

## Thermal Mass Effects

**Larger Batches**:
- More thermal mass
- Slower temperature changes
- More momentum
- Stable but less responsive

**Smaller Batches**:
- Less thermal mass
- Faster temperature changes
- More responsive
- Risk of over/under

## Optimal Batch Size

**Roaster Capacity**: Usually rated at maximum
**Optimal**: 60-80% of maximum
- Better heat distribution
- More control
- Consistent results
- Room for variability

**Too Small** (<40%):
- Uneven heating
- Rapid changes
- Difficult control
- Scorching risk

**Too Large** (>90%):
- Poor circulation
- Uneven roasting
- Extended times
- Quality inconsistency

## Consistency Factors

**Variables Affected by Size**:
- Charge temperature (higher for larger)
- Development time
- Heat application
- Airflow needs

**Profile Adjustment**:
- Different profiles per batch size
- Document all parameters
- Test and verify
- Maintain records

## Practical Applications

**For Roasters**:
- Standardize batch sizes
- Adjust profiles accordingly
- Document variations
- Quality verification

**For Consistency**:
- Same size batches
- Same profile
- Predictable results
- Professional standards
