# ⚡ Catalytic Reactions in Roasting

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced

---

## 📋 Overview

Catalytic reactions accelerate chemical transformations during roasting - with acids, heat, and metal ions catalyzing Maillard reactions, caramelization, and pyrolysis for faster flavor development.

**Catalysts in Coffee Roasting**:
- **Acids**: Catalyze sugar breakdown
- **Heat**: Primary catalyst (temperature acceleration)
- **Minerals**: Metal ions catalyze reactions

## 🔬 Effects

**Acceleration**: Catalysts speed reactions without being consumed  
**Flavor Development**: Faster Maillard, caramelization  
**RoastingMenuHeat is primary catalyst (exponential temp effects)

---

## 📝 Summary

Catalytic reactions (acid-catalyzed, heat-accelerated) speed chemical transformations during roasting - primarily through temperature's exponential effect on reaction rates.
