# 🔥 Development Time Ratio (DTR) in Coffee Roasting

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand and optimize post-crack development timing

---

## 📋 Overview

Development Time Ratio (DTR) is the percentage of total roast time spent after first crack begins - a critical metric for roast quality that separates developed, complex roasts from underdeveloped, baked, or rushed results. Proper DTR ensures flavor development, sweetness extraction, and balanced complexity.

**What is DTR**:
- **Definition**: (Development Time / Total Roast Time) × 100
- **Development Time**: Time from first crack start to drop (end of roast)
- **Total Roast Time**: Charge to drop (complete roast duration)
- **Example**: 2 minutes development in 12 minute roast = 16.7% DTR
- **Typical Range**: 15-25% for quality roasts
- **Critical Metric**: Indicates roast development adequacy

**Why DTR Matters**:
- **Development**: Ensures proper flavor development post-crack
- **Sweetness**: Adequate development extracts sweetness
- **Balance**: Prevents under-development (grassy, sour) or rushing
- **Consistency**: Repeatable target for consistent roasts
- **Quality**: Professional roasters target DTR ranges
- **Communication**: Share roast profiles precisely

## 📊 DTR Guidelines

**General Recommendations**:

**Light Roasts** (City):
- **DTR**: 12-18%
- **Development**: 60-90 seconds
- **Total Roast**: 9-11 minutes typical
- **Character**: Bright, complex, origin-forward

**Medium Roasts** (Full City):
- **DTR**: 15-20%
- **Development**: 90-150 seconds
- **Total Roast**: 10-12 minutes typical
- **Character**: Balanced, sweet, chocolate develops

**Medium-Dark** (Vienna):
- **DTR**: 18-25%
- **Development**: 120-180+ seconds
- **Total Roast**: 10-13 minutes
- **Character**: Dark chocolate, caramel, fuller body

**Key Principle**: Longer total roast generally needs higher DTR %

## ⚠️ DTR Problems

**Too Low (<12%)**:
- **Underdeveloped**: Grassy, vegetal, sour
- **Rushed**: Insufficient flavor development
- **Fix**: Extend development time

**Too High (>25%)**:
- **Baked**: Flat, dull, bread-like
- **Fix**: Shorten development, increase pre-crack heat

**Ideal**: 15-20% for most quality roasts

## 📝 Summary

Development Time Ratio (DTR) measures post-crack development as percentage of total roast time - critical metric ensuring adequate flavor development (15-25% typical) while preventing under-development (<12%) or baking (>25%).

**Key Takeaways**:
- **DTR**: Development time ÷ total roast time × 100
- **Ideal**: 15-20% for most roasts
- **Light**: 12-18% DTR
- **Medium**: 15-20% DTR
- **Quality**: Proper DTR ensures developed, sweet, balanced coffee
