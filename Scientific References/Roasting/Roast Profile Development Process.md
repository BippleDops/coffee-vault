# 🔥 Roast Profile Development Process

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Systematic approach to creating optimal roast profiles

---

## 📋 Overview

Roast profile development transforms coffee into its best expression - systematic process of sampling, cupping, adjusting, and refining roast parameters until optimal profile emerges. Understanding methodical profile development enables consistent excellence and prevents wasteful trial-and-error roasting.

**What is Profile Development**:
- **Definition**: Creating optimal roast curve for specific coffee
- **Process**: Sample → cup → adjust → repeat until perfect
- **Variables**: Charge temp, heat application, airflow, development time
- **Goal**: Maximize sweetness, balance, complexity for that bean
- **Documentation**: Record successful profiles for repeatability

**Why Systematic Approach Matters**:
- **Efficiency**: Faster than random experimentation
- **Quality**: Methodical testing finds optimal profile
- **Consistency**: Documentation enables repetition
- **Learning**: Understanding principles vs. luck
- **Professional**: Required for commercial roasting

## 🎯 Development Process

**Step 1: Research** (Before Roasting):
- **Origin Info**: Altitude, processing, variety, density
- **Similar Coffees**: How similar beans roast
- **Starting Profile**: Educated guess based on characteristics

**Step 2: Sample Roast** (First Attempt):
- **Conservative**: Start with safe, moderate profile
- **Document**: Record all parameters
- **Target**: Light-medium initially (can always go darker)

**Step 3: Cupping Evaluation**:
- **Systematic**: Cup using SCA protocol
- **Note**: What's good, what needs improvement
- **Analysis**: Under/over-developed? Too fast/slow? Defects?

**Step 4: Adjustment** (Based on Cupping):
- **Under-Extracted Flavors**: Increase development time
- **Over-Extracted**: Decrease development or lower charge
- **Grassy**: Extend drying phase
- **Baked**: Increase heat during browning
- **One Variable**: Change one thing at a time

**Step 5: Repeat** (Iterate Until Optimal):
- **Sample Again**: With adjustments
- **Cup**: Evaluate improvements
- **Refine**: Continue until perfect
- **Document**: Record final successful profile

## 📝 Summary

Roast profile development follows systematic process - research coffee characteristics, sample conservatively, cup rigorously, adjust one variable based on feedback, repeat until optimal. Methodical approach finds best profile faster than random experimentation while building roasting knowledge and ensuring repeatability.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Systematic**: Research → sample → cup → adjust → repeat
- **One Variable**: Change one thing at a time
- **Document**: Record parameters for repeatability
- **Cupping**: Rigorous evaluation drives decisions
- **Professional**: Required for commercial quality
