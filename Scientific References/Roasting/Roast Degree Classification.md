# Roast Degree Classification

## Overview

Roast degree classification helps communicate roast levels consistently. Multiple naming systems exist, but understanding the underlying principles clarifies all classification methods.

## Common Classification Systems

### SCAA Roast Color Classification

**Scientific Standard**:
- Agtron scale: 0-100
- Measured with spectrophotometer
- Objective color measurement
- Industry standard

**Roast Levels**:
- **Light**: Agtron 70-80
- **Medium-Light**: Agtron 60-70
- **Medium**: Agtron 50-60
- **Medium-Dark**: Agtron 40-50
- **Dark**: Agtron 30-40
- **Very Dark**: Agtron <30

### Traditional Naming

**Common Names**:
1. Light/Cinnamon Roast
2. City Roast
3. City+ Roast
4. Full City Roast
5. Full City+ Roast
6. Vienna Roast
7. French Roast
8. Italian Roast
9. Spanish Roast

**Ambiguity**:
- Names vary by region
- No standardization
- Subjective interpretation
- Better to use objective measures

## Visual Characteristics

### Light Roast

**Appearance**:
- Light brown, cinnamon color
- No surface oil
- Dry surface
- Lighter weight

**Bean Characteristics**:
- First crack completed
- Dense structure
- Minimal expansion
- Original bean shape visible

**Color**: Agtron 70+

### Medium Roast

**Appearance**:
- Medium brown, milk chocolate
- No or minimal surface oil
- Mostly dry
- Moderate weight

**Bean Characteristics**:
- After first crack, before second
- Moderate expansion
- More developed
- Balanced

**Color**: Agtron 50-60

### Medium-Dark Roast

**Appearance**:
- Dark brown, darker chocolate
- Some surface oil beginning
- Semi-glossy patches
- Lighter weight than medium

**Bean Characteristics**:
- Approaching or beginning second crack
- Significant expansion
- Well-developed
- Some oil migration

**Color**: Agtron 40-50

### Dark Roast

**Appearance**:
- Very dark brown to black
- Obvious surface oil
- Glossy, shiny surface
- Light weight

**Bean Characteristics**:
- Through second crack
- Maximum expansion
- Fragile structure
- Heavy oil migration

**Color**: Agtron 30-40

### Very Dark Roast

**Appearance**:
- Nearly black
- Very oily surface
- Shiny, wet-looking
- Very light weight

**Bean Characteristics**:
- Well into second crack
- Charring possible
- Very fragile
- Heavy oil coating

**Color**: Agtron <30

## Temperature Milestones

**Development Timeline**:
- 165-185°C: Yellowing phase
- 196°C: First crack begins (typical)
- 205°C: First crack ends
- 205-220°C: Development phase
- 220°C: Second crack begins (typical)
- 225-240°C: Dark roast territory
- 240°C+: Danger zone (fire risk)

## Flavor Characteristics by Roast

### Light Roast

**Flavor Profile**:
- Origin characteristics dominant
- Bright, high acidity
- Floral, fruity notes
- Tea-like body
- Complex, nuanced

**Best For**:
- Single-origin appreciation
- Exploring terroir
- Delicate flavors
- Morning coffee

### Medium Roast

**Flavor Profile**:
- Balance of origin and roast
- Moderate acidity
- Caramel, nutty notes
- Medium body
- Versatile

**Best For**:
- All-day drinking
- Multiple brew methods
- Broad appeal
- Consistent experience

### Dark Roast

**Flavor Profile**:
- Roast character dominant
- Low acidity
- Smoky, bitter notes
- Heavy body
- Bold, intense

**Best For**:
- Espresso
- Milk drinks
- Traditional preferences
- Strong caffeine perception

## Regional Roasting Preferences

### Nordic/Scandinavian

**Preference**: Light to very light
- Preserve origin character
- Bright acidity valued
- Fruit-forward
- Modern specialty approach

### North American Specialty

**Preference**: Light to medium
- Balance origin and development
- Highlight complexity
- Versatile roasting
- Third wave standard

## Roast Level and Brewing

### Light Roast Brewing

**Challenges**:
- Can taste sour if under-extracted
- Requires precise brewing
- Higher water temperature needed
- Grind size critical

**Best Methods**:
- Pour-over (V60, Chemex)
- Aeropress
- Clever Dripper

**Parameters**:
- Temperature: 93-96°C
- Ratio: 1:15-1:17
- Time: Adequate extraction essential

### Dark Roast Brewing

**Advantages**:
- Forgiving extraction
- Hard to over-extract
- Consistent results
- Lower skill floor

**Best Methods**:
- Espresso
- French Press
- Moka Pot
- Drip coffee

**Parameters**:
- Temperature: 88-92°C (lower)
- Ratio: 1:14-1:16
- Time: Standard for method

## Chemical Changes by Roast Level

### Light Roast Chemistry

- High chlorogenic acids (antioxidants)
- More caffeine per volume
- Higher citric acid
- More organic acids
- Less caramelization products

### Dark Roast Chemistry

- Low chlorogenic acids (degraded)
- Less caffeine per volume
- Higher quinic acid
- Fewer organic acids
- More caramelization products

## Consumer Guidance

### Choosing Roast Level

**Prefer Bright, Acidic Coffee**:
- Choose: Light roast
- Origins: Ethiopian, Kenyan
