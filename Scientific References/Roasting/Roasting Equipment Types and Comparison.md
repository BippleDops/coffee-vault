# 🔥 Coffee Roasting Equipment Comparison

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee roasters fall into two main categories - drum roasters (rotating drum, traditional) and fluid bed roasters (hot air suspension, modern) - each with distinct advantages for heat transfer, capacity, and roast character.

**Two Primary Types**:
1. **Drum Roasters**: Rotating drum, conduction + convection
2. **Fluid Bed**: Hot air suspends beans, pure convection

---

## 🥁 Drum Roasters

**How They Work**:
- **Rotating Drum**: Beans tumble in rotating cylinder
- **Heat**: Gas burner, electric elements
- **Transfer**: Conduction (drum contact) + Convection (hot air)
- **Capacity**: 100g to 120kg+ batches

**Advantages**:
- **Traditional**: Classic roast character
- **Control**: Fine heat control
- **Versatility**: All roast levels
- **Scalable**: Small to very large capacities

**Examples**: Probat, Diedrich, Loring, Giesen, most commercial roasters

## 🌀 Fluid Bed Roasters

**How They Work**:
- **Hot Air**: Powerful fan blows hot air upward
- **Suspension**: Beans suspended in hot air stream
- **Transfer**: Pure convection (no drum contact)
- **Capacity**: Typically smaller (50-500g batches)

**Advantages**:
- **Fast**: Roasts faster (efficient heat transfer)
- **Clean**: No drum scorching risk
- **Even**: Uniform roasting (all beans in airstream)

**Limitations**:
- **Capacity**: Usually smaller batches
- **Dark Roast**: Difficult (beans blow out)

**Examples**: Sivetz, Fresh Roast, some home roasters

---

## ⚖️ Comparison

**Drum**:
- Traditional character, versatile, scalable, most common

**Fluid Bed**:
- Fast, clean, even, but limited capacity and dark roast challenges

**Choice**: Depends on capacity needs, roast style, budget

---

## 📝 Summary

Drum roasters (rotating drum, conduction + convection) dominate commercial roasting through versatility and scalability; fluid bed roasters (hot air suspension, pure convection) offer fast, even roasting but limited capacity. Choosing roaster type depends on production needs, roast style goals, and budget.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Drum**: Traditional, versatile, scalable, conduction + convection
- **Fluid Bed**: Fast, clean, pure convection, smaller capacity
- **Commercial**: Drum roasters dominate (capacity, versatility)
- **Home**: Both types available at small scale
