# 🎯 Roast Uniformity and Consistency

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Achieve consistent, uniform roasts batch-to-batch

---

## 📋 Overview

Roast uniformity (evenness within batch) and consistency (repeatability between batches) separate professional from amateur roasting - requiring careful heat management, proper technique, and documentation to achieve identical results batch after batch, essential for quality control and customer satisfaction.

**Uniformity** (Within Batch):
- **Definition**: All beans in same batch roast evenly
- **Goal**: Minimal color/development variation within batch
- **Measurement**: Visual inspection, Agtron range
- **Importance**: Even flavor, no under/over-developed beans mixed

**Consistency** (Between Batches):
- **Definition**: Same coffee roasts identically batch-to-batch
- **Goal**: Repeatable results
- **Measurement**: Agtron matching, cupping comparison
- **Importance**: Customer expects same coffee every time

---

## 🎯 Achieving Uniformity

**Even Heat Distribution**:
- **Proper Drum Speed**: Ensures beans tumble evenly
- **Adequate Airflow**: Uniform heat distribution
- **Batch Size**: 60-80% capacity optimal (too small or large reduces uniformity)
- **Preheating**: Warm drum/roaster before charging

**Avoiding Hot Spots**:
- **Proper Charge**: Don't overload or underload
- **Heat Management**: Avoid excessive heat (scorching) or insufficient (baking)
- **Monitoring**: Watch for uneven development signs

## 🔁 Achieving Consistency

**Documentation**:
- **Record Everything**: Charge temp, heat settings, airflow, timing
- **Roast Curves**: Log temperature curves, RoR
- **Notes**: Environmental conditions, observations

**Matching Profiles**:
- **Same Charge**: Use same charge temperature
- **Same Profile**: Follow documented heat curve
- **Same Environment**: Control ambient conditions
- **Same Batch Size**: Maintain batch size consistency

**Quality Control**:
- **Agtron Testing**: Measure roast color batch-to-batch
- **Cupping**: Regular cupping ensures flavor consistency
- **Adjustments**: Tweak profile when drift detected

## 📝 Summary

Roast uniformity (evenness within batch) requires proper heat distribution, adequate airflow, and optimal batch size (60-80% capacity); roast consistency (repeatability between batches) requires meticulous documentation, profile matching, and quality control through Agtron testing and cupping. Professional roasting achieves both through disciplined technique and systematic approach.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Uniformity**: All beans in batch roast evenly
- **Consistency**: Same results batch-to-batch
- **Documentation**: Record all parameters for repeatability
- **QC**: Agtron and cupping verify consistency
- **Professional**: Both uniformity and consistency essential
