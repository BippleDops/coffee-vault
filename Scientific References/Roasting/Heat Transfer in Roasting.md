# Heat Transfer in Coffee Roasting

## Overview

Coffee roasting is fundamentally about heat transfer—moving thermal energy from heat source to bean interior. Understanding the three modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) is essential for roast control and consistency.

## Three Modes of Heat Transfer

### 1. Conduction

**Definition**:
- Direct contact heat transfer
- Molecule-to-molecule energy transfer
- Physical contact required
- Occurs at drum surface

**In Coffee Roasting**:
- Bean touches hot drum surface
- Heat conducts from metal to bean
- Creates "contact points"
- Responsible for surface browning

**Characteristics**:
- Very efficient heat transfer
- Can cause scorching if excessive
- Creates "tipping" defect if too hot
- Dominant in drum roasters

**Control Variables**:
- Drum speed (more contact = more conduction)
- Drum temperature
- Batch size (bean-to-bean contact)
- Charge temperature

### 2. Convection

**Definition**:
- Heat transfer through fluid movement (hot air)
- Air molecules carry thermal energy
- Requires airflow
- Most controllable mode

**In Coffee Roasting**:
- Hot air circulates around beans
- Uniform heat distribution
- Gentle, even roasting
- Dominant in fluid bed roasters

**Characteristics**:
- Even heat distribution
- Easier to control
- Less scorching risk
- Slower than conduction

**Control Variables**:
- Airflow rate (fan speed)
- Air temperature
- Roaster design
- Exhaust management

### 3. Radiation (Infrared)

**Definition**:
- Electromagnetic radiation
- No medium required
- Line-of-sight heat transfer
- From hot surfaces

**In Coffee Roasting**:
- Heat radiates from drum walls
- From roaster interior surfaces
- From burner/heating elements
- Penetrates bean surface

**Characteristics**:
- Can penetrate deeper
- Contributes to interior development
- Less understood than other modes
- Difficult to measure

**Control Variables**:
- Roaster design (surface area)
- Material emissivity
- Burner type
- Roaster size

## Heat Transfer Balance

### Drum Roasters

**Typical Heat Mix**:
- Conduction: 30-40%
- Convection: 40-50%
- Radiation: 15-25%

**Variables Affect Balance**:
- Drum speed (faster = less conduction)
- Airflow (more = more convection)
- Batch size (larger = less conduction per bean)

### Fluid Bed Roasters

**Typical Heat Mix**:
- Conduction: <5%
- Convection: 90-95%
- Radiation: 5-10%

**Characteristics**:
- Very even roasting
- Fast roast capability
- Minimal scorching
- Less traditional flavor

### Hybrid Roasters

**Combining Modes**:
- Drum with high airflow
- Perforated drums
- Adjustable ratios
- Flexibility for roast profile

## Bean Temperature Dynamics

### Internal vs Surface Temperature

**Surface Temperature**:
- Higher than interior initially
- Direct heat exposure
- Conducts inward
- Risks scorching

**Core Temperature**:
- Lags behind surface
- Heat gradually penetrates
- Final temperature similar to surface
- Development depends on core temp

**Temperature Gradient**:
- Difference between surface and core
- Large gradient = risk of uneven roast
- Goal: Minimize gradient
- Slower roast = smaller gradient

### Heat Penetration

**Factors Affecting Penetration**:
- Bean density (denser = slower)
- Bean size (larger = slower)
- Bean moisture (affects thermal conductivity)
- Roast rate (faster = larger gradient)

**Development Implications**:
- Need adequate time for heat to reach center
- Too fast = surface over-roasted, interior under-roasted
- Balanced heat penetration = even development

## Roast Profile Control

### Charge Temperature

**Definition**:
- Drum temperature when beans are dropped in
- Critical initial condition
- Affects early roast development

**Typical Range**:
- Light roasts: 180-200°C
- Medium roasts: 190-210°C
- Dark roasts: 200-220°C

**Impact**:
- Higher charge: Faster initial heat transfer
- Lower charge: Gentler start
- Must balance with batch size

### Rate of Rise (ROR)

**Definition**:
- Temperature increase per unit time
- Typically measured per minute
- Key roast control metric

**Typical Pattern**:
- High at start (8-12°C/min)
- Gradually declining throughout roast
- Lower at finish (2-4°C/min)
- Smooth curve preferred

**Control**:
- Burner/heat adjustment
- Airflow changes
- Drum speed (some roasters)

### Turning Point

**Definition**:
- Lowest bean temperature after charge
- Beans absorb heat initially
- Temperature drops then rises
- Critical early indicator

**Importance**:
- Should occur within 1-2 minutes
- Too long: Insufficient heat
- Too short: Excessive heat
- Indicates proper charge temp

## Energy Phases

### Drying Phase (Up to ~150°C)

**Heat Transfer**:
- All modes active
- Endothermic (beans absorb heat)
- Moisture evaporation
- Temperature rise slows

**Energy Requirements**:
- Substantial energy to evaporate water
- Temperature plateaus slightly
- Must maintain heat application
- Typically 4-8 minutes

**Objective**:
- Remove moisture uniformly
- Prepare for development
- Don't rush this phase

### Development Phase (150-205°C)

**Heat Transfer**:
- Balanced transfer
- Maillard reactions begin
- Exothermic reactions start
- Complex chemistry

**Energy Dynamics**:
- Chemical reactions generate heat
- Bean becomes more reactive
- Temperature rise accelerates
- Critical flavor development

**Objective**:
- Controlled development
- Balance all transfer modes
- Avoid scorching
- Build complexity

### Pyrolysis Phase (205°C+)

**Heat Transfer**:
- Highly exothermic
- Beans generating heat
- Risk of runaway reaction
- Careful control required

**Energy Dynamics**:
- First crack: Endothermic pause
- After first crack: Exothermic surge
- Second crack: More energy release
- Can self-accelerate

**Objective**:
- Control exothermic reactions
- Don't let temp run away
- Achieve target development
- Stop at desired point
