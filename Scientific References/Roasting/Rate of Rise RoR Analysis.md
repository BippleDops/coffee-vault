# 🔥 Rate of Rise (RoR) Analysis in Coffee Roasting

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand and control roast development through RoR monitoring

---

## 📋 Overview

Rate of Rise (RoR) is the speed at which bean temperature increases during roasting - the most important metric for controlling roast development, predicting roast outcomes, and achieving consistency. Monitoring and managing RoR separates amateur from professional roasting, enabling precise control over flavor development and roast quality.

**What is RoR**:
- **Definition**: Speed of temperature increase (degrees per time unit)
- **Measurement**: °F/minute or °C/minute
- **Example**: RoR of 10°F/min means bean temp rising 10°F every minute
- **Dynamic**: Changes continuously throughout roast
- **Critical**: Indicates roast development, predicts outcomes
- **Control**: Adjust heat/airflow to manage RoR

**Why RoR Matters**:
- **Development Control**: Manage flavor development precisely
- **Consistency**: Repeat successful roasts by matching RoR curves
- **Prediction**: Anticipate first crack, end time
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose roast problems (flicks, crashes, stalls)
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune profiles for specific beans
- **Professional Standard**: Required knowledge for commercial roasting

## 📊 RoR Curve Phases

### Ideal RoR Pattern

**Typical Roast RoR Progression**:

1. **Charge to Turning Point** (0:00-1:00):
   - **RoR**: Negative or zero (beans cool drum)
   - **Turning Point**: Lowest bean temp, then starts rising

2. **Drying Phase** (1:00-6:00):
   - **RoR**: Increases rapidly then gradually declines
   - **Peak RoR**: Often 60-80°F/min early
   - **Decline**: Gradual decrease to 30-40°F/min by end of drying

3. **Browning/Maillard** (6:00-9:00):
   - **RoR**: Continues gradual decline
   - **Target**: 20-30°F/min entering first crack

4. **First Crack** (9:00-10:00):
   - **RoR**: Spike upward (exothermic reactions)
   - **Increase**: May jump 10-20°F/min from exothermic heat

5. **Development** (10:00-12:00):
   - **RoR**: Declining from first crack spike
   - **Management**: Control decline rate via heat/airflow
   - **Target**: Gradual decline to end

**Ideal Pattern**: **Declining RoR with controlled first crack spike**

## ⚠️ Common RoR Problems

**1. Flicking** (Sudden RoR Spikes):
- **Cause**: Abrupt heat increases
- **Effect**: Uneven development, scorching risk
- **Fix**: Smooth, gradual heat adjustments

**2. Crashing** (RoR Plummets):
- **Cause**: Too much heat reduction, airflow increase
- **Effect**: Stalled roast, baking, under-development
- **Fix**: Less aggressive heat reduction

**3. Baking** (Flat RoR):
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat during browning
- **Effect**: Flat, bready, under-developed flavors
- **Fix**: Increase heat application in browning phase

## 📝 Summary

Rate of Rise (RoR) is roasting's most critical metric - indicating roast development speed, enabling consistency, and providing control over flavor development. Understanding and managing RoR transforms roasting from guesswork to precision, enabling professional-level consistency and optimization.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **RoR**: Temperature increase speed (°F/min)
- **Pattern**: Declining RoR with first crack spike ideal
- **Control**: Adjust heat/airflow to manage RoR
- **Consistency**: Match RoR curves for repeatable roasts
- **Professional**: Essential metric for quality roasting
