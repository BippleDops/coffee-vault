# First and Second Crack Explained

## Overview

First and second crack are audible sounds during coffee roasting, marking critical development stages. Understanding these phenomena is essential for roasting coffee and comprehending roast levels.

## What Causes the Cracks?

### Physical Mechanism

**Pressure Build-Up**:
- Water and CO2 trapped inside bean
- Heat creates steam and gas expansion
- Pressure increases inside cellular structure
- Cell walls rupture when pressure exceeds strength

**Energy Release**:
- Sudden release of pressure
- Audible "crack" or "pop"
- Multiple cracks as batch roasts
- Creates distinctive sound pattern

## First Crack

### When It Occurs

**Temperature Range**:
- Arabica: Typically 196-205°C (385-401°F)
- Robusta: Slightly higher (200-210°C)
- Varies by bean density, moisture, roaster

**Timing**:
- Usually 7-12 minutes into roast
- Depends on roast profile
- Fast roasts: Earlier
- Slow roasts: Later

### Physical Changes

**What's Happening**:
- Steam buildup from water vaporization
- CO2 generation from chemical reactions
- Cell structure expanding
- Bean volume increases ~50-80%

**Visible Signs**:
- Bean color: Yellowing to light brown
- Surface becomes matte
- Chaff (silverskin) loosening
- Beans actively expanding

**Audible Characteristics**:
- Sound: Sharp, crisp "crack"
- Pattern: Begins slowly, builds to crescendo
- Duration: 1-3 minutes typical
- Intensity: Relatively loud, distinct

### Chemical Reactions at First Crack

**Maillard Reactions**:
- Peak activity
- Browning accelerates
- Flavor compound formation
- Aromatic development

**Pyrolysis Begins**:
- Decomposition of organic compounds
- CO2 production accelerates
- Water evaporation peaks

**Caramelization Starts**:
- Sugar breakdown initiating
- Sweet flavor development
- Color darkening

### Roast Levels Around First Crack

**City Roast** (End of first crack):
- Light-medium roast
- Balanced development
- Origin characteristics clear
- Moderate acidity

**City+ Roast** (Just after first crack):
- Medium roast
- Good development
- Balanced sweetness
- Popular roast level

**Full City** (Between cracks):
- Medium-dark approaching
- Caramelization active
- Sweetness well-developed
- Less acidity

## Second Crack

### When It Occurs

**Temperature Range**:
- Arabica: Typically 220-230°C (428-446°F)
- About 20-30°C after first crack
- Timing varies significantly

**Timing**:
- Usually 12-18 minutes into roast
- Depends heavily on roast rate
- Fast roasts: Second crack comes quickly
- Slow roasts: Longer gap between cracks

### Physical Changes

**What's Happening**:
- Cell wall structure breaking down
- Oils migrating to surface
- Further expansion (though less than first)
- Bean becoming more fragile

**Visible Signs**:
- Bean color: Dark brown to black
- Surface becomes glossy (oils appearing)
- Smoke production increases
- Bean structure weakening

**Audible Characteristics**:
- Sound: Softer, faster "snapping"
- Pattern: More rapid than first crack
- Duration: Can continue for several minutes
- Intensity: Quieter than first crack

### Chemical Reactions at Second Crack

**Pyrolysis Intensifies**:
- Rapid decomposition
- CO2 production peaks
- Organic compounds breaking down
- Charring beginning

**Oil Migration**:
- Heat mobilizes lipids
- Oils move to bean surface
- Surface glossiness appears
- Oxidation risk increases

**Sugar Degradation**:
- Most sugars consumed
- Caramelization complete
- Bitterness developing
- Sweetness declining

### Roast Levels Around Second Crack

**Vienna/Light French** (Beginning of second):
- Dark roast territory
- Oils beginning to appear
- Roast flavor dominant
- Origin receding

**French Roast** (Into second crack):
- Very dark
- Heavy oil on surface
- Roast flavor dominant
- Bitter, smoky

**Italian/Spanish** (Through second crack):
- Extremely dark
- Very oily
- Charred notes
- Nearly black beans

## The Gap Between Cracks

### Development Phase

**Critical Period**:
- Between end of first and beginning of second
- 5-15 minutes depending on profile
- Most medium roasts occur here
- Peak complexity development

**Chemistry Active**:
- Maillard reactions continuing
- Caramelization active
- Flavor balance optimizing
- Sweetness at peak

**Roaster Control**:
- Heat adjustments critical
- Rate of rise management
- Development time ratio
- Avoiding scorching or baking

## Roast Profile Strategies

### Fast Roast

**Characteristics**:
- Shorter overall time (8-12 minutes)
- Cracks come closer together
- Less development time
- Riskier for consistency

**Result**:
- Brighter acidity
- Less body development
- More origin character
- Can be underdeveloped if too fast

### Slow Roast

**Characteristics**:
- Longer overall time (12-18 minutes)
- Cracks more separated
- More development time
- Easier to control

**Result**:
- More body development
- Sweeter
- Can become baked if too slow
- Caramelization more complete

### Optimal Development

**Balance**:
- Total time: 10-15 minutes typical
- First crack around 8-10 minutes
- Development after first crack: 2-4 minutes
- Never rush through cracks

## Listening to the Cracks

### First Crack Sound Profile

**Beginning**:
- Isolated pops
- Slow rate
- Distinct individual cracks

**Peak**:
- Rapid succession
- "Popcorn" sound
- Multiple overlapping cracks
- Loudest phase

**End**:
- Slowing frequency
- Sporadic pops
- Quieting
- Indicates crack completing

### Second Crack Sound Profile

**Beginning**:
- Faster, lighter snapping
- More rapid than first crack
- Less distinct
- Softer sound

**Characteristics**:
- Sounds like Rice Krispies
- Can be constant during peak
- Less dramatic than first crack
- Easy to miss if not attentive

## Using Cracks for Roast Control

### Timing Roasts

**Before First Crack**:
- Monitor temperature rise
- Control heat to hit target
- Manage moisture evaporation
- Prepare for crack

**During First Crack**:
- Reduce heat slightly (many roasters)
- Listen for peak
- Decide target finish point
- Monitor carefully

**Between Cracks**:
- Control development
- Adjust heat for desired time
- Sample if possible
- Watch for smoke

**At/After Second Crack**:
- Dark roast territory
- Can proceed or stop
- Fire danger increases
- Decision point

## Temperature Monitoring

### Internal Bean Temperature

**Critical Temps**:
- 165-185°C: Yellowing, drying complete
- 196°C: First crack begins (typical)
- 205°C: First crack ending
- 220°C: Second crack begins
- 230°C: Well into second crack
- 240°C+: Danger zone (fire risk)

**Probe vs Bean**:
- Probe temperature lags bean temperature
- Endothermic first crack (temp pauses)
- Exothermic afterwards (temp rises faster)

## Common Mistakes

### Rushing First Crack

**Problem**:
- Under-development
- Grassiness remains
- Sour notes
- Baked character

**Solution**:
- Adequate development time
- 15-25% development time ratio
- Don't drop at first crack onset

### Baking Between Cracks

**Problem**:
- Too long at low heat
- Flat, dull flavors
- Loss of vibrancy
- Excessive development

**Solution**:
- Maintain heat through development
- Reasonable rate of rise
- Active roasting, not passive

### Missing Second Crack

**Problem**:
- Can't hear it start
- Over-roast by accident
- Burn beans

**Solution**:
- Listen carefully
- Watch smoke production
- Monitor temperature closely
- Have target temperature

## Practical Applications

### For Home Roasters

**Roasting by Ear**:
- Listen for first crack start
- Count time after first crack
- Decide stop point
- Light: Right after first crack
- Medium: 2-3 min after first
- Dark: Into or through second

### For Commercial Roasters

**Consistency**:
- Log crack times
- Reproduce timing
- Use temperature probes
- Profile adherence
- Batch consistency

### For Buyers

**Understanding Roast Levels**:
- "City" = Right after first crack
- "Full City" = Before second crack
- "Vienna" = Beginning second crack
- "French" = Through second crack

## Crack Absence or Problems

### No First Crack

**Causes**:
- Bean too dense
- Moisture too low
- Temperature too low
- Underdeveloped green beans

### Weak First Crack

**Causes**:
- Old beans (low moisture)
- Very dense beans
- Slow roast profile
- Can still be good coffee

### No Second Crack

**Normal**:
- Stopping before second crack is common
- Most specialty roasts stop before second
- Not a problem
- Intentional choice

## Conclusion

First and second crack:
- Mark critical roast stages
- Indicate chemical transitions
- Guide roast development
- Help achieve desired levels
- Essential for roast control

Understanding cracks helps:
- Control roast profiles
- Achieve consistency
- Develop desired flavors
