# 🔥 Batch Size Effects on Roast Development

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand how batch size affects roasting dynamics

---

## 📋 Overview

Batch size dramatically affects roasting dynamics - larger batches require more heat, cool drum more, and roast differently than small batches even on same machine. Understanding batch size effects enables consistent roasting across different batch sizes and optimal capacity utilization.

**Why Batch Size Matters**:
- **Thermal Mass**: More beans = more heat required
- **Heat Capacity**: Beans absorb heat (larger batch absorbs more)
- **Turning Point**: Batch size affects how much beans cool drum
- **Heat Recovery**: Larger batches need more heat to recover
- **Roast Time**: Batch size can affect total roast duration
- **Consistency**: Different batch sizes roast differently

**Typical Roaster Capacity**:
- **Home Roasters**: 100-500g batches
- **Sample Roasters**: 100-300g
- **Small Commercial**: 1-5kg batches
- **Medium**: 5-15kg
- **Large**: 15-70kg+

**Optimal Capacity**: 60-80% of drum capacity (balance efficiency and quality)

## 🔬 Thermal Dynamics

**Small Batch** (<50% capacity):
- **Turning Point**: Deep (beans cool drum significantly)
- **Heat Recovery**: Fast (small mass heats quickly)
- **Heat Needs**: Less heat application required
- **Challenge**: Easy to scorch (excessive heat for small mass)
- **Roast Time**: Often faster (less thermal inertia)

**Optimal Batch** (60-80% capacity) ⭐:
- **Turning Point**: Moderate, manageable
- **Heat Recovery**: Balanced, controlled
- **Heat Needs**: Roaster designed for this range
- **Quality**: Best, most consistent results
- **Efficiency**: Good heat utilization

**Large Batch** (80-100% capacity):
- **Turning Point**: Shallow (beans don't cool drum much)
- **Heat Recovery**: Slow (large mass requires energy)
- **Heat Needs**: Maximum heat application
- **Challenge**: Insufficient heat can cause baking
- **Roast Time**: Often slower (large thermal inertia)

## 🎯 Adjusting for Batch Size

**Charge Temperature**:
- **Small Batch**: Lower charge (360-380°F) - less thermal mass
- **Standard**: Normal charge (380-400°F)
- **Large Batch**: Higher charge (400-420°F) - more thermal mass

**Heat Application**:
- **Small**: Reduce heat aggressively (avoid scorching)
- **Standard**: Normal profile
- **Large**: Increase heat (prevent baking)

**Airflow** (If Adjustable):
- **Small**: Less airflow (retain heat)
- **Standard**: Normal
- **Large**: More airflow (manage heat)

## 📝 Summary

Batch size affects roasting dynamics through thermal mass - small batches (<50%) cool drum deeply and require less heat (scorch risk), optimal batches (60-80%) balance efficiency and quality, large batches (80-100%) need maximum heat to avoid baking. Adjusting charge temperature, heat application, and airflow for batch size enables consistent quality across different batch sizes.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Thermal Mass**: Larger batch = more heat needed
- **Optimal**: 60-80% drum capacity for best results
- **Small Batch**: Lower charge, less heat (scorch risk)
- **Large Batch**: Higher charge, more heat (baking risk)
- **Consistency**: Adjust profile for batch size
