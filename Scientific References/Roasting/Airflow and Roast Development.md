# Airflow and Roast Development

## Overview

Airflow is a critical but often overlooked roasting variable. It affects heat transfer, chaff removal, smoke evacuation, and flavor development. Understanding airflow enables better roast control.

## Functions of Airflow

### 1. Heat Transfer (Convection)

**Primary Function**:
- Hot air circulates around beans
- Convective heat transfer
- Even temperature distribution
- Efficient energy use

**Impact**:
- Higher airflow = more convective heat
- Lower airflow = more conductive/radiative
- Balance affects roast character

### 2. Chaff Removal

**Chaff (Silverskin)**:
- Paper-thin skin on green beans
- Releases during roasting
- Can burn if not removed
- Creates smoke and off-flavors

**Airflow Solution**:
- Carries chaff away
- Prevents burning
- Cleaner roast
- Better flavor

### 3. Smoke Evacuation

**Smoke Production**:
- Increases during roast
- Especially in development phase
- Contains volatile compounds
- Can affect flavor if not removed

**Airflow Management**:
- Constant evacuation
- Prevents smoke taint
- Clean environment
- Quality preservation

### 4. Moisture Removal

**Drying Phase**:
- Water vapor must exit
- Airflow carries moisture away
- Enables continued drying
- Critical early in roast

## Airflow Control

### Variable Airflow Systems

**Adjustable Fan Speed**:
- Modern roaster feature
- Profiles include airflow changes
- Fine control possible
- Complexity increases

**Typical Pattern**:
- Start: Moderate airflow
- Drying: Increase to remove moisture
- Maillard: Reduce slightly
- Development: Increase for smoke removal
- Finish: High for cooling

### Fixed Airflow Systems

**Traditional Roasters**:
- Airflow set by design
- Chimney/damper only control
- Less flexible
- Simpler operation

**Damper Control**:
- Opens/closes exhaust
- Affects draft
- Indirect airflow control
- Traditional method

## Airflow and Heat Balance

### High Airflow

**Effects**:
- More convective heat transfer
- Faster roasting possible
- Cooler bean surface (evaporative cooling)
- Cleaner roast

**Flavor Impact**:
- Brighter, more acidic
- Cleaner cup
- Less body development
- More origin character

**Applications**:
- Light roasts
- High-density beans
- Clean profiles
- Acidity preservation

### Low Airflow

**Effects**:
- More conductive/radiative heat
- Slower roasting
- Warmer bean surface
- More development

**Flavor Impact**:
- More body
- Deeper flavors
- Less brightness
- More caramelization

**Applications**:
- Dark roasts
- Body development
- Traditional profiles

## Roast Phase Airflow Strategies

### Drying Phase

**Increase Airflow**:
- Remove moisture effectively
- Prevent stalling
- Even drying
- Foundation for development

**Typical**: 70-80% of maximum

### Maillard Phase

**Moderate Airflow**:
- Allow heat to develop
- Don't cool beans excessively
- Balanced transfer
- Flavor building

**Typical**: 50-60% of maximum

### Development Phase

**Increase Airflow**:
- Remove smoke
- Cool slightly post-crack
- Control exothermic
- Clean finish

**Typical**: 80-100% of maximum

## Bean Density and Airflow

### High-Density Beans

**Require**:
- Higher airflow
- Better heat penetration
- Moisture removal
- Longer development

### Low-Density Beans

**Require**:
- Moderate airflow
- Gentler approach
- Scorching prevention
- Careful monitoring

## Practical Applications

### For Roasters

**Airflow Profiling**:
- Document airflow changes
- Include in profiles
- Adjust for bean characteristics
- Experiment systematically

**Consistency**:
- Reproduce airflow settings
- Critical for batch matching
- Environmental compensation
- Quality assurance

### For Home Roasters

**Understanding Equipment**:
- Fluid bed: Airflow-dependent
- Drum: Less airflow-sensitive
- Adjust technique accordingly

## Conclusion

Airflow management:
- Critical roasting variable
- Affects heat transfer and flavor
- Requires understanding and control
- Enables optimization
