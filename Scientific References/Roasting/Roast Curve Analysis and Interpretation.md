# 📈 Roast Curve Analysis

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Interpret roast curves for quality and consistency

---

## 📋 Overview

Roast curve analysis reveals roast quality through temperature and RoR patterns - enabling diagnosis of problems (flicking, crashing, baking), optimization opportunities, and repeatability through curve matching.

**What to Analyze**:
- **Temperature Curve**: Bean temp over time
- **RoR Curve**: Rate of rise changes
- **Phases**: Drying, browning, development timing
- **Patterns**: Ideal vs. problematic patterns

---

## 📊 Ideal Curve Characteristics

**Smooth**: No sudden jumps or drops  
**Declining RoR**: Gradual decrease from peak  
**Controlled Spike**: Manageable first crack RoR increase  
**Appropriate Times**: Drying 4-6min, total 10-12min typical

---

## ⚠️ Problem Patterns

**Flicking** (RoR Spikes):
- **Cause**: Abrupt heat increases
- **Fix**: Smoother heat adjustments

**Crashing** (RoR Plummets):
- **Cause**: Excessive heat reduction
- **Fix**: Less aggressive cooling

**Flat** (Baking):
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat
- **Fix**: Increase heat during browning

---

## 📝 Summary

Roast curve analysis through temperature and RoR patterns reveals quality and enables optimization - ideal curves show smooth progression with declining RoR, while problematic curves (flicking, crashing, flat) indicate heat management issues correctable through technique adjustments.
