# 🌀 Airflow Management in Coffee Roasting

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand airflow's role in heat transfer and roast control

---

## 📋 Overview

Airflow is roasting's critical heat transfer variable - controlling how heat reaches beans (convection), removing chaff and smoke, and affecting roast development speed and evenness. Proper airflow management separates consistent, quality roasts from uneven, defective results.

**Why Airflow Matters**:
- **Heat Transfer**: Convection (hot air) transfers heat to beans
- **Smoke Removal**: Airflow removes smoke, prevents redeposition
- **Chaff Removal**: Carries chaff away from beans
- **Development Control**: Affects roast speed and evenness
- **Temperature**: Influences bean temperature and RoR
- **Consistency**: Proper airflow ensures repeatable roasts

**Three Heat Transfer Methods in Roasting**:
1. **Conduction**: Drum contact (30-40%)
2. **Convection**: Hot air (40-50%) ← **Airflow controls this**
3. **Radiation**: Heat radiation (10-20%)

**Airflow Controls Convection** (40-50% of total heat transfer)

## 🔬 Airflow Effects

**High Airflow**:
- **Cooling Effect**: Removes heat from roast environment
- **Faster Heat Transfer**: More hot air contact per time
- **Chaff Removal**: Excellent chaff evacuation
- **Drying**: Faster moisture removal
- **RoR Impact**: Can lower RoR (cooling effect)
- **Development**: Can slow development if too high

**Low Airflow**:
- **Heat Retention**: Keeps heat in drum
- **Slower Convection**: Less air movement
- **Chaff Accumulation**: Chaff may stick to beans
- **Moisture Retention**: Slower drying
- **Smoke**: Smoke may redeposit on beans
- **Baking Risk**: Insufficient air can cause baking

**Optimal Airflow** (Balanced):
- Adequate heat transfer
- Smoke and chaff removal
- Even development
- Controlled RoR

## 🎯 Airflow Adjustment Strategy

**Drying Phase** (0-6 minutes):
- **Moderate Airflow**: Allow heat retention
- **Goal**: Efficient moisture removal without excessive cooling

**Browning Phase** (6-9 minutes):
- **Increase Slightly**: Enhance heat transfer
- **Goal**: Accelerate Maillard reactions

**First Crack** (9-10 minutes):
- **Increase Airflow**: Cool beans (exothermic phase)
- **Goal**: Manage exothermic heat generation

**Development** (10-12 minutes):
- **High Airflow**: Control temperature rise
- **Goal**: Prevent runaway, manage development

## 📝 Summary

Airflow controls convective heat transfer (40-50% of roasting heat) - managing how hot air heats beans, removes smoke/chaff, and affects development speed. Proper airflow management (moderate during drying, increased during development) enables even roasting, smoke removal, and controlled development while preventing baking (too low) or excessive cooling (too high).

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Convection**: Airflow controls 40-50% of heat transfer
- **Drying**: Moderate airflow (heat retention)
- **Development**: High airflow (cooling, smoke removal)
- **Balance**: Too high cools excessively, too low causes baking
- **Adjustable**: Dynamic airflow management optimizes roasting
