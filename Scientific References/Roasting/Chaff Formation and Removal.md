# 🌾 Chaff Formation and Removal

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Purpose**: Understand chaff and its removal

---

## 📋 Overview

Chaff (silverskin) is coffee's papery outer layer that separates during roasting - requiring removal for clean roasts and fire prevention. Understanding chaff formation and removal ensures roaster safety, cleanliness, and quality.

**What is Chaff**:
- **Silverskin**: Thin papery layer between parchment and bean
- **Separation**: Breaks off during first crack and development
- **Byproduct**: Roasting waste product
- **Removal**: Must be removed (fire hazard, affects flavor if redeposited)

**Why Remove Chaff**:
- **Fire Hazard**: Chaff is combustible (fire risk if accumulates)
- **Flavor**: Redeposited chaff creates off-flavors
- **Cleanliness**: Messy, clogs equipment
- **Quality**: Clean roasts require chaff removal

## 🔥 Chaff Formation

**When**:
- **First Crack**: Main chaff release (beans crack, chaff flies off)
- **Development**: Continued release throughout development
- **Amount**: 1-4% of green coffee weight

**Removal Methods**:
- **Airflow**: Fan blows chaff out of roaster
- **Chaff Collector**: Cyclone or bag collects chaff
- **Manual**: Winnowing (home roasting)

## 📝 Summary

Chaff (silverskin layer) separates during first crack requiring removal through airflow and chaff collection to prevent fire hazard, ensure cleanliness, and maintain quality.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Chaff**: Papery silverskin, separates at first crack
- **Fire Hazard**: Combustible, must remove
- **Removal**: Airflow blows chaff to collector
- **Safety**: Regular chaff collector emptying essential
