**Advantages**:
- Fast roasting (6-8 minutes)
- Energy efficient
- Clean flavor
- Minimal maintenance

**Disadvantages**:
- Non-traditional flavor
- Limited to light/medium
- Capacity typically smaller

**Examples**: Sivetz, some Loring models

### Hybrid/Semi-Fluid Bed

**Design**:
- Combines drum and fluid bed concepts
- Perforated drum
- High airflow
- Modern approach

**Advantages**:
- Efficiency of fluid bed
- Flavor of drum (closer)
- Fast roasting
- Clean emissions

**Examples**: Loring Smart Roast series

## Key Features

### Heat Source

**Gas**:
- Most common
- Responsive control

- Urban locations
- Higher operating cost
- Precise control

### Afterburners

**Emissions Control**:
- Required in many jurisdictions
- Burns smoke and VOCs
- Catalytic or thermal
- Environmental compliance

**Types**:
- Catalytic: Lower temperature, catalyst
- Thermal: High temperature oxidation
- Investment: $10,000-100,000+

### Data Logging

## Capacity Decisions

### Matching to Business

**Café Roasting**:
- 1-5kg typical
- On-demand roasting
- Customer viewing
- Fresh for customers

**Startup Specialty**:
- 5-15kg
- Room to grow
- Wholesale capability

- Professional scale

### Throughput Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Hourly Capacity = Batch Size / (Roast Time + Cool + Load)

Example: 12kg / (12min + 5min cool + 3min load)
= 12kg / 20min = 36kg/hour
```

**Planning**:
- Account for downtime
- Multiple batches same profile
- Profile changes (cleaning between)
- Realistic estimates

## Investment Considerations

### Total Cost of Ownership

**Equipment**: Purchase price
**Installation**: Gas, electric, ventilation
**Afterburner**: Often required
**Accessories**: Cooling, storage, tools
**Training**: Learning curve
**Maintenance**: Annual service

**Example Budget** (15kg roaster):
- Roaster: $40,000
- Installation: $10,000
- Afterburner: $20,000
- Accessories: $5,000
- **Total**: $75,000
