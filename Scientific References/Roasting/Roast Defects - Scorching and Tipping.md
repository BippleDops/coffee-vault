# 🔥 Roast Defects - Scorching and Tipping

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand, prevent, and correct roasting defects

---

## 📋 Overview

Scorching and tipping are coffee roasting's most common defects - caused by excessive heat application creating burned exterior while interior remains underdeveloped. Understanding these defects' causes enables prevention through proper heat management, ensuring quality roasts and avoiding wasted coffee.

**Scorching**:
- **Definition**: Burned exterior, patches of charred surface
- **Cause**: Excessive heat, too fast roasting
- **Visual**: Black spots, charred patches on bean surface
- **Flavor**: Burnt, acrid, harsh, bitter

**Tipping**:
- **Definition**: Burned tips of elongated beans
- **Cause**: High heat on dense beans, especially high-altitude
- **Visual**: Darkened/blackened bean tips (pointed ends)
- **Flavor**: Slight burnt notes, less severe than scorching

**Prevention**: Proper heat management, appropriate charge temp, adequate drying

## 🔬 Causes and Prevention

**Scorching Causes**:
1. **Too High Charge Temp**: Beans hit excessive heat immediately
2. **Excessive Heat**: Too much burner during roast
3. **Insufficient Airflow**: Heat accumulates without removal
4. **Too Fast**: Rushing roast, inadequate time for heat penetration

**Prevention**:
- Lower charge temperature
- Moderate heat application (steady, not aggressive)
- Adequate airflow (remove excess heat)
- Slower roast (allow even heat penetration)

**Tipping Causes**:
1. **High-Altitude Dense Beans**: Dense exterior, slower heat penetration
2. **Excessive Heat on Dense Beans**: Kenya, Ethiopian SHB especially prone
3. **Insufficient Drying**: Moisture inside when exterior gets hot

**Prevention**:
- Lower charge for dense beans
- Extended drying phase (ensure moisture removal)
- Moderate heat during browning
- Adequate total roast time

## 📝 Summary

Scorching (burned exterior) and tipping (burned bean tips) result from excessive heat application - prevented through lower charge temperatures for dense beans, moderate steady heat (not aggressive), adequate drying time (moisture removal before high heat), and sufficient airflow (heat removal). Proper heat management eliminates these quality-destroying defects.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Scorching**: Burned exterior from excessive heat
- **Tipping**: Burned tips on dense beans
- **Prevention**: Lower charge, moderate heat, adequate drying, good airflow
- **Dense Beans**: High-altitude coffees most prone (Kenya, Ethiopia, Guatemala SHB)
