# 🔄 Drum Speed and Heat Transfer

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand drum rotation effects on roasting

---

## 📋 Overview

Drum speed (rotation rate) affects heat transfer, bean tumbling, and roast evenness - with optimal speeds (30-60 RPM typical) ensuring beans tumble through hot air without excessive friction or insufficient movement. Understanding drum speed enables better heat management and consistent roasting.

**Why Drum Speed Matters**:
- **Heat Transfer**: Affects convection, conduction
- **Tumbling**: Ensures beans move through hot air evenly
- **Evenness**: Proper speed creates uniform roasting
- **Friction**: Too fast increases friction/heat
- **Consistency**: Stable speed ensures repeatability

## 🔬 Speed Effects

**Standard Speed** (30-60 RPM):
- **Optimal**: Balanced tumbling, heat transfer
- **Even**: Uniform roasting
- **Common**: Most roasters operate this range

**Slow** (<30 RPM):
- **Less Tumbling**: Beans don't cascade properly
- **Uneven**: Risk of uneven roasting
- **Rare**: Most roasters avoid very slow

**Fast** (>60 RPM):
- **Friction**: Increased heat from friction
- **Aggressive**: More aggressive roasting
- **Some Use**: Specific roasting styles

## 📝 Summary

Drum speed affects roasting through tumbling and heat transfer - optimal speeds (30-60 RPM) ensure even tumbling and uniform roasting, while too slow risks uneven roasting and too fast increases friction. Standard drum speeds create consistent, repeatable roasts.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Optimal**: 30-60 RPM typical
- **Function**: Tumbling, heat transfer
- **Evenness**: Proper speed ensures uniformity
- **Consistency**: Stable speed enables repeatability
