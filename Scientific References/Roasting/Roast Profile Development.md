# Roast Profile Development

## Overview

A roast profile is a time-temperature curve guiding coffee roasting from start to finish. Developing effective profiles is essential for consistency, quality, and achieving target flavor characteristics.

## What is a Roast Profile?

### Definition

**Roast Profile**:
- Temperature vs time curve
- From charge to drop
- Includes all control inputs
- Recipe for repeatable roasting

**Components**:
- Charge temperature
- Heat application schedule
- Airflow adjustments (if applicable)
- Development time ratio
- Total roast time
- Drop temperature

## Profile Stages

### 1. Drying Phase (Yellow Phase)

**Duration**: 4-8 minutes typically
**Temperature Range**: Charge temp → 165°C
**Goal**: Remove moisture uniformly

**Characteristics**:
- Endothermic (beans absorb heat)
- Grassy smell initially
- Color: Green → Yellow → Tan
- Weight loss: ~12% (water)

**Heat Management**:
- Steady heat application
- Avoid stalling
- Don't rush
- Foundation for later development

**Rate of Rise (ROR)**:
- Starts high (8-12°C/min)
- Gradually decreasing
- Smooth curve preferred
- No flat spots

### 2. Maillard Phase (Browning)

**Duration**: 3-6 minutes
**Temperature Range**: 165°C → 196°C (first crack)
**Goal**: Develop flavor compounds

**Characteristics**:
- Maillard reactions active
- Browning accelerates
- Sweet, bread-like aromas
- Color: Tan → Light Brown → Brown

**Heat Management**:
- Critical control period
- Determines flavor development
- Too fast = underdeveloped
- Too slow = baked character

**Rate of Rise**:
- Continuing to decline
- 5-8°C/min typical
- Smooth transition
- Approaching first crack

### 3. Development Phase (After First Crack)

**Duration**: 1.5-4 minutes
**Temperature Range**: 196°C → Drop temp
**Goal**: Achieve target roast level

**Characteristics**:
- First crack begins/progresses
- Caramelization active
- Pyrolysis beginning
- Critical flavor formation

**Heat Management**:
- Often reduce heat
- Control exothermic reactions
- Manage rate of rise
- Hit target without rushing

**Development Time Ratio (DTR)**:
- DTR = Development Time / Total Time
- Typical: 15-25%
- Light roast: 15-18%
- Medium: 18-22%
- Dark: 20-25%+

## Profile Parameters

### Charge Temperature

**Definition**: Drum temperature when beans loaded

**Typical Ranges**:
- Light roast target: 190-200°C
- Medium roast: 195-210°C
- Dark roast: 200-220°C

**Factors**:
- Batch size (larger = higher charge)
- Bean density (denser = higher)
- Ambient temperature
- Roaster type

### Total Roast Time

**Ranges**:
- Fast: 8-11 minutes
- Standard: 11-15 minutes
- Slow: 15-18+ minutes

**Trade-offs**:
- Fast: More acidity, less body
- Slow: More body, risk of baking
- Sweet spot: 12-14 minutes for most

### Drop Temperature

**By Roast Level**:
- Light: 196-205°C
- Medium: 210-220°C
- Medium-Dark: 220-230°C
- Dark: 230-240°C

### Rate of Rise (ROR)

**Ideal Curve**:
- Starts high (10-12°C/min)
- Gradually declining throughout
- Smooth, no crashes
- Ends moderate (2-4°C/min)

**ROR Management**:
- Primary control variable
- Heat adjustments affect ROR
- Smooth curve = even development
- Crashes = flavor defects

## Creating a Profile

### Step 1: Define Goals

**Target**:
- Roast level (light/medium/dark)
- Flavor characteristics desired
- Origin considerations
- Customer preferences

### Step 2: Initial Roast

**First Attempt**:
- Start with standard profile
- Log everything
- Note times and temperatures
- Cup the result

**Data Collection**:
- Charge temp
- Turning point
- Yellowing time
- First crack time
- Drop time and temp
- Weight loss

### Step 3: Evaluation and Adjustment

**Cupping Assessment**:
- Taste critically
- Note defects
- Identify issues
- Compare to target

**Adjustments**:

**Too Sour/Bright**:
- Longer development
- Higher drop temp
- Slower drying phase

**Too Bitter/Dark**:
- Shorter development
- Lower drop temp
- Faster profile

**Baked**:
- Faster overall
- Higher heat in Maillard
- Avoid stalling ROR

### Step 4: Iteration

**Refine**:
- Make one change at a time
- Cup each iteration
- Document changes
- Narrow to target

**Convergence**:
- Usually 3-5 iterations
- Fine-tune final
- Lock in profile
- Reproduce consistently

## Advanced Concepts

### Development Time Ratio (DTR)

**Calculation**:
```
DTR = (Drop Time - First Crack Time) / Total Roast Time × 100%
```

**Optimal Ranges**:
- Light: 15-18%
- Medium: 18-22%
- Dark: 20-25%

**Impact**:
- Low DTR: Underdeveloped, sour
- High DTR: Over-developed, flat
- Sweet spot: Balanced complexity

### Flick, Crash, Flick

**Concept**:
- Heat adjustments at key points
- "Flick": Small increase
- "Crash": Reduction
- Timing matters

**Application**:
- Before first crack: Often reduce heat
- After first crack: May flick up
- Approaching drop: Final crash
- Roaster-dependent

### Momentum and Thermal Mass

**Roaster Inertia**:
- Drum retains heat
- Delayed response to changes
- Must anticipate
- Experience teaches timing

**Bean Mass**:
- Larger batches = more thermal mass
- Slower to respond
- More momentum
- Different profiles needed
