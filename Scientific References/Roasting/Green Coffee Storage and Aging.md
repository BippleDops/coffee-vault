# 📦 Green Coffee Storage and Aging

**Category**: Roasting / Green Coffee Handling  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand green coffee preservation and aging effects

---

## 📋 Overview

Green coffee storage conditions dramatically affect quality - with proper storage (cool, dry, low oxygen) preserving coffee 6-12 months while poor storage (heat, humidity, oxygen) degrades quality in weeks. Understanding storage and aging enables quality preservation and explains "past crop" vs. "new crop" pricing differences.

**Why Storage Matters**:
- **Quality Degradation**: Poor storage destroys quality rapidly
- **Aging**: Green coffee ages, changes over months/years
- **Economics**: Proper storage preserves value
- **Flavor**: Storage affects roasted coffee flavor
- **Freshness**: "New crop" vs. "past crop" pricing reflects age

**Optimal Storage**:
- **Temperature**: 60-70°F (15-21°C), cool
- **Humidity**: 60-65% RH (prevents too dry or too wet)
- **Oxygen**: Minimal (hermetic bags, vacuum, nitrogen flush)
- **Light**: Dark (light degrades)
- **Pests**: Pest-free environment

## 🔬 Aging Effects

**First 3 Months** (Peak Freshness):
- **Flavor**: Vibrant, full complexity
- **Acidity**: Bright, lively
- **Aromatics**: Maximum volatile content
- **Quality**: Peak cup quality

**3-6 Months** (Good):
- **Flavor**: Still good, slight fading
- **Acidity**: Mellowing slightly
- **Aromatics**: Decreasing gradually
- **Quality**: Acceptable, good storage critical

**6-12 Months** (Past Crop):
- **Flavor**: Noticeably faded, "baggy" notes emerging
- **Acidity**: Muted, flat
- **Aromatics**: Significantly reduced
- **Quality**: Declining, price discounts

**12+ Months** (Old Crop):
- **Flavor**: Stale, woody, baggy, cardboard
- **Acidity**: Flat, dead
- **Quality**: Poor, avoid unless aged intentionally

**Exception - Intentional Aging**:
- **Monsooned Malabar**: Aged for unique flavor
- **Aged Indonesian**: Some aged intentionally
- **Rare**: Most coffee quality declines with age

## 💰 Market Impact

**New Crop** (0-6 months):
- **Premium**: Full price, peak quality
- **Demand**: Specialty buyers seek new crop

**Past Crop** (6-12 months):
- **Discount**: 10-30% price reduction
- **Quality**: Acceptable if stored well
- **Common**: Often blended or commercial use

**Old Crop** (12+ months):
- **Heavy Discount**: 30-50%+ reduction
- **Quality**: Poor, commodity use only

## 📝 Summary

Green coffee degrades over time - peak quality first 3 months, good 3-6 months, declining 6-12 months, poor beyond 12 months. Proper storage (cool 60-70°F, dry 60-65% RH, low oxygen, dark) extends quality life; poor storage accelerates degradation. "New crop" vs. "past crop" pricing reflects age-related quality differences.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Peak**: 0-3 months (new crop premium)
- **Good**: 3-6 months (acceptable with good storage)
- **Declining**: 6-12 months (past crop discounts)
- **Poor**: 12+ months (avoid except intentionally aged)
- **Storage**: Cool, dry, low oxygen, dark conditions essential
