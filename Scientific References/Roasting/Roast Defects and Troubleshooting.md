# Roast Defects and Troubleshooting

## Overview

Recognizing and correcting roast defects is essential for quality coffee. Understanding causes enables prevention and systematic quality improvement.

## Common Roast Defects

### Underdeveloped (Grassy/Baked)

**Symptoms**:
- Grassy, hay-like flavors
- Peanutty notes
- Sour, astringent
- Lack of sweetness

**Causes**:
- Insufficient development time
- Dropped too early
- Too-fast roast (rushed Maillard)
- Inadequate heat in development

**Cup Impact**: Moderate to severe

**Fix**:
- Longer development time
- Higher drop temperature
- More heat in Maillard phase
- Slower overall profile

### Baked

**Symptoms**:
- Flat, bread-like
- Dull, lifeless
- Lacks complexity
- Papery notes

**Causes**:
- Stalled temperature rise
- Extended roast at too-low heat
- Flat ROR (rate of rise)
- Insufficient heat application

**Cup Impact**: Moderate

**Fix**:
- Faster overall profile
- Higher heat to prevent stalling
- Avoid flat spots in curve
- Active heat management

### Scorched

**Symptoms**:
- Burnt, acrid taste
- Dark spots on beans
- Ashy notes
- Harsh bitterness

**Causes**:
- Excessive heat
- Poor drum rotation
- Beans stuck to drum
- Too-high charge temperature

**Cup Impact**: Moderate to severe

**Fix**:
- Lower heat application
- Better agitation
- Lower charge temp
- Even heat distribution

### Tipped

**Symptoms**:
- Darkened bean tips
- Slight burnt notes
- Visual defect primarily

**Causes**:
- Too-hot charge temperature
- Thin bean ends overheat
- Rapid initial heat transfer

**Cup Impact**: Mild

**Fix**:
- Lower charge temperature
- Gentler initial heat
- Better heat distribution

### Quakers (Unroasted Beans)

**Symptoms**:
- Light-colored beans after roast
- Peanutty, raw flavor
- Don't brown properly

**Causes**:
- Defective green beans (didn't ripen)
- Not a roasting defect
- Pre-roast sorting needed

**Cup Impact**: Mild to moderate (depends on quantity)

**Fix**:
- Sort green coffee before roasting
- Remove light beans after roasting
- Better green coffee sourcing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Sour Coffee

**Diagnosis**:
- Under-developed
- Insufficient roast time
- Too-light drop

**Solution**:
- Increase development time
- Higher finish temperature
- Fuller roast

### Problem: Bitter Coffee

**Diagnosis**:
- Over-roasting
- Too dark
- Charring

**Solution**:
- Lighter roast level
- Lower drop temperature
- Faster profile

### Problem: Flat/Dull

**Diagnosis**:
- Baked defect
- Temperature stalled
- Too-slow roast

**Solution**:
- Faster overall
- Maintain heat throughout
- Avoid flat ROR spots

### Problem: Uneven Roasting

**Diagnosis**:
- Mixed bean colors
- Inconsistent development
- Some scorched, others under

**Solution**:
- Better agitation
- Lower heat
- More uniform heat distribution
- Smaller batches

### Problem: Smoky/Burnt

**Diagnosis**:
- Over-roasting
- Scorching
- Char development

**Solution**:
- Lower temperatures
- Better ventilation
- Don't roast as dark
- Clean roaster (old chaff burning)

## Prevention Strategies

### Pre-Roast

**Green Coffee Quality**:
- Source specialty grade
- Sort defects
- Verify moisture content
- Proper storage

### During Roast

**Monitoring**:
- Watch temperatures closely
- Listen to cracks
- Smell changes
- Visual assessment

**Control**:
- Smooth heat management
- Avoid rushes or stalls
- Consistent agitation
- Target adherence

### Post-Roast

**Cooling**:
- Rapid cooling essential
- Prevents further development
- Preserves intended roast
- Remove chaff

**Quality Check**:
- Visual inspection
- Smell assessment
- Remove obvious defects
- Cupping verification

## Cupping to Diagnose

**Systematic Tasting**:
- Identify specific defect flavors
- Trace to roast stage
- Correlate to profile data
- Implement corrections

**Record Keeping**:
- Note defects
- Link to roast data
- Track frequency
- Improvement verification

## Equipment-Related Defects

### Burner Issues

**Problem**: Flame inconsistency
**Result**: Uneven roasting
**Fix**: Burner service, cleaning

### Probe Problems

**Problem**: Temperature inaccuracy
**Result**: Incorrect roast decisions
**Fix**: Calibration, replacement

### Airflow Issues

**Problem**: Inadequate ventilation
**Result**: Smoky, baked character
**Fix**: Fan service, duct cleaning

## Conclusion

Roast defects:
- Preventable with knowledge
- Diagnostic with systematic approach
- Correctable through profiling
- Quality improvement opportunity

Understanding defects enables:
- Consistent quality
- Problem prevention
- Rapid troubleshooting
- Professional results
