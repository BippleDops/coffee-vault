# 🔥 Charge Temperature and Initial Heat Management

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand charge temp effects and initial roast phase control

---

## 📋 Overview

Charge temperature (drum/air temperature when green beans added) is roasting's foundation - setting initial conditions that affect every subsequent phase, determining turning point depth, drying duration, and overall roast trajectory. Proper charge temp and heat recovery management separate consistent, quality roasts from unpredictable, defective results.

**What is Charge Temperature**:
- **Definition**: Roaster drum/air temperature at moment green beans added
- **Typical Range**: 350-420°F (177-216°C) depending on roaster, batch size, bean type
- **Critical**: Sets entire roast trajectory
- **Variable**: Adjusted based on bean density, batch size, desired profile
- **Consistency**: Same charge temp aids repeatability

**Why Charge Temp Matters**:
- **Turning Point**: Affects how low beans cool drum (turning point)
- **Heat Recovery**: Determines how quickly roaster recovers heat
- **Drying Phase**: Influences drying duration and evenness
- **Total Time**: Affects total roast time significantly
- **Consistency**: Same charge temp → more consistent roasts
- **Defect Prevention**: Wrong charge temp causes scorching or baking

## 🌡️ Charge Temperature Effects

**High Charge Temp** (410-420°F/210-216°C):
- **Turning Point**: Shallow (beans don't cool drum much)
- **Heat Recovery**: Very fast
- **Drying**: Shorter, faster
- **Risk**: Scorching (too much heat too fast), tipping
- **Use**: Very dense beans (high-altitude), large batches
- **Control**: Requires aggressive heat reduction to avoid scorching

**Moderate Charge** (380-400°F/193-204°C) ⭐ **Most Common**:
- **Turning Point**: Moderate depth (balanced)
- **Heat Recovery**: Normal, controlled
- **Drying**: Standard 4-6 minutes
- **Balance**: Even development, manageable
- **Use**: Most coffees, standard roasting
- **Versatile**: Works for wide variety of beans

**Low Charge** (350-370°F/177-188°C):
- **Turning Point**: Deep (beans cool drum significantly)
- **Heat Recovery**: Slow
- **Drying**: Extended, longer phase
- **Risk**: Baking (insufficient heat), underdevelopment
- **Use**: Low-density beans, small batches, very gentle roasts
- **Control**: Requires heat application to avoid stalling

**Key Principle**: Match charge temp to bean characteristics and desired profile

## 📊 Turning Point Explained

**What is Turning Point**:
- **Definition**: Lowest bean temperature after charge (before rising)
- **Cause**: Green beans (room temp) cool hot drum
- **Duration**: 30 seconds to 3 minutes after charge
- **Depth**: How much beans cool drum

**Turning Point Depth**:
- **Shallow** (bean temp drops 10-30°F): High charge, dense beans
- **Moderate** (drops 30-60°F): Standard conditions  
- **Deep** (drops 60-100°F+): Low charge, light beans, large batch

**Why It Matters**:
- **Trajectory Indicator**: Predicts roast development
- **Consistency**: Similar turning point → similar roast
- **Heat Application**: Informs heat needs during drying

## 🎯 Adjusting Charge for Different Beans

**Dense, High-Altitude Beans** (Kenya, Ethiopia, Guatemala SHB):
- **Higher Charge**: 395-410°F
- **Why**: Dense beans absorb more heat, need energy
- **Result**: Adequate heat for even development

**Standard Beans** (Colombia, Central America, moderate altitude):
- **Standard Charge**: 380-395°F
- **Why**: Balanced density, standard heat needs
- **Result**: Typical roast development

**Light, Low-Density Beans** (Brazil lowland, naturals):
- **Lower Charge**: 365-380°F
- **Why**: Absorb heat quickly, lower density, scorch risk
- **Result**: Gentle development, avoiding scorching

**Very Small Batch** (100-200g sample roasting):
- **Lower Charge**: 350-375°F
- **Why**: Small mass cools drum more, less thermal inertia
- **Result**: Controlled, gentle roasting

**Large Batch** (80-100% drum capacity):
- **Higher Charge**: 400-420°F
- **Why**: Large mass needs more initial heat
- **Result**: Adequate heat for large batch roasting

## 🔧 Heat Recovery Management

**After Charge** (First 2 Minutes):
- **Temperature Drops**: Beans cool drum/air
- **Turning Point**: Reaches lowest temperature
- **Recovery Begins**: Temperature starts rising
- **Heat Application**: Critical to manage recovery rate

**Ideal Heat Recovery**:
- **Turning Point**: 60-90 seconds after charge
- **Recovery**: Smooth, steady temperature rise
- **Target**: Return to charge temp by 3-4 minutes
- **Rate of Rise**: Building gradually, controlled

**Poor Heat Recovery**:
- **Too Slow**: Baking, flat flavors, insufficient heat
- **Too Fast**: Scorching, uneven roast, excessive heat

## 📝 Summary

Charge temperature sets roasting's foundation - determining turning point depth, heat recovery rate, and overall roast trajectory. Proper charge temp (matched to bean density, batch size, and profile goals) enables consistent, quality roasting while preventing scorching (too hot) or baking (too cool). Standard charge (380-400°F) works for most coffees; adjust higher for dense beans or large batches, lower for light beans or small batches.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Charge Temp**: Drum/air temperature when beans added
- **Typical**: 380-400°F (193-204°C) for most roasts
- **Dense Beans**: Higher charge (395-410°F)
- **Light Beans**: Lower charge (365-380°F)
- **Turning Point**: Lowest temp after charge, indicates heat needs
- **Recovery**: Heat management critical after charge
- **Consistency**: Same charge temp aids repeatability
