# Roast Color Measurement and Analysis

## Overview

Objective color measurement provides consistent roast level assessment, quality control, and communication. Agtron scales and colorimeters standardize what was once subjective.

## Agtron Scale

**Range**: 0-100
- 0 = Black
- 100 = White
- Coffee range: 25-95

**Roast Levels**:
- Very Light: 80-95
- Light: 70-80
- Medium-Light: 60-70
- Medium: 50-60
- Medium-Dark: 40-50
- Dark: 30-40
- Very Dark: 25-30

## Measurement Methods

**Spectrophotometer**:
- Light reflectance measurement
- Objective, precise
- Industry standard
- Expensive ($3,000-15,000)

**ColorTrack**:
- Digital photo analysis
- Smartphone apps
- Lower cost
- Less precise but useful

**Visual Comparison**:
- Agtron tile sets
- Visual matching
- Subjective but accessible
- Basic quality control

## Practical Applications

**Quality Control**:
- Batch-to-batch consistency
- Verify roast level
- Customer communication
- Objective standard

**Profile Development**:
- Target color goals
- Reproduction verification
- Development correlation

## Limitations

**Color ≠ Development**:
- Same color, different development possible
- Baked coffee can match proper color
- Internal development matters most
- Cup quality ultimate test

## Conclusion

Color measurement:
- Useful quality tool
- Objective standard
- Not complete picture
- Supplement to cupping
