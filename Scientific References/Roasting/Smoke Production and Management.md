# 💨 Smoke Production and Management

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand smoke production and safe ventilation

---

## 📋 Overview

Smoke production during roasting requires proper ventilation - with smoke increasing at first crack and dramatically at second crack, containing volatile organics requiring exhaust for air quality, safety, and preventing smoke redeposition on beans.

**Smoke Sources**:
- **Chaff Burning**: Chaff combustion creates smoke
- **Pyrolysis**: Thermal decomposition releases volatiles
- **Oil Volatilization**: Oils vaporizing at high temps
- **Carbon Formation**: Dark roasts produce more smoke

**Why Ventilation Matters**:
- **Air Quality**: Smoke contains irritants
- **Safety**: Proper exhaust prevents accumulation
- **Flavor**: Smoke redeposition creates acrid flavors
- **Fire Prevention**: Removes combustible volatiles

## 🔥 Smoke by Roast Phase

**Drying** (Minimal):
- Little smoke, mostly steam

**Browning** (Moderate):
- Smoke begins, chaff may burn

**First Crack** (Increasing):
- Smoke production increases
- Chaff released and burns

**Development** (Heavy):
- Significant smoke (pyrolysis)

**Second Crack** (Very Heavy):
- Maximum smoke (severe pyrolysis, oil volatilization)
- Requires excellent ventilation

## 🌀 Ventilation

**Proper System**:
- **Exhaust Hood**: Captures smoke at source
- **Ductwork**: Vents outside (never recirculate)
- **Fan**: Adequate CFM for roaster size
- **Maintenance**: Regular cleaning (creosote buildup)

---

## 📝 Summary

Smoke production increases through roasting phases (minimal drying → heavy at second crack) requiring proper ventilation through exhaust hood and ductwork to maintain air quality, prevent smoke redeposition, and ensure safety.
