# 💧 Moisture Content Monitoring

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Green coffee moisture (10-12%) must be removed during roasting - with drying phase (first 4-6 minutes) being critical for proper roast development and avoiding defects.

**Moisture Phases**:
- **Green**: 10-12% moisture
- **Drying** (0-6min): Majority of moisture lost
- **Roasted**: <2% moisture remaining

**Why Moisture Management Matters**:
- **Proper Development**: Adequate drying enables even roasting
- **Defects**: Insufficient drying causes baking, underdevelopment
- **Quality**: Moisture removal timing affects final cup

## 📝 Summary

Moisture removal during drying phase (first 4-6 minutes) is critical for roast quality - inadequate drying creates defects while proper moisture management enables even development and quality roasts.
