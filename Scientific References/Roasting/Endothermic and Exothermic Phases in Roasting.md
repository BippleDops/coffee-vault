# 🔥 Endothermic and Exothermic Phases in Roasting

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Basic roasting knowledge, thermodynamics concepts  
**Learning Objectives**: Understand heat dynamics in roasting, control roast development

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee roasting involves dramatic thermodynamic transformations - beans absorbing heat (endothermic) and generating heat (exothermic) in distinct phases throughout the roast. Understanding these energy dynamics is critical for controlling roast development, achieving desired flavors, and troubleshooting roast defects.

**Why Endothermic/Exothermic Matters**:
- **Heat Control**: Knowing when beans absorb vs. generate heat informs heat management
- **First Crack Prediction**: Exothermic phase begins at first crack
- **Roast Development**: Understanding energy flow enables better profile design
- **Avoiding Defects**: Mismanaging energy phases causes baking, scorching, crashing
- **Rate of Rise (RoR)**: Energy phases explain RoR curves
- **Consistency**: Repeatability requires understanding energy dynamics

## 🔬 Thermodynamic Fundamentals

**Endothermic Process**:
- **Definition**: Absorbs energy from surroundings
- **In Roasting**: Beans absorb heat from roaster environment
- **Temperature Effect**: Bean temperature rises
- **Energy Source**: Roaster drum, air, burner heat

**Exothermic Process**:
- **Definition**: Releases energy to surroundings
- **In Roasting**: Chemical reactions in beans generate heat
- **Temperature Effect**: Bean temperature rises independently of applied heat
- **Energy Source**: Chemical reactions (pyrolysis, Maillard, caramelization)

## 🌡️ Roast Phases

### Phase 1: Drying/Dehydration (Endothermic)

**Temperature**: Charge to ~350°F (177°C)  
**Duration**: 4-8 minutes  
**Energy**: Strongly Endothermic

**What Happens**:
- **Water Evaporation**: 10-12% moisture evaporates (steam released)
- **Heat Absorption**: Beans absorb heat continuously, rapidly
- **Color**: Green → Yellow
- **Chemistry**: Primarily physical (water loss), minimal chemical reactions
- **Smell**: Grassy, hay-like, bread-like emerging

**Heat Dynamics**:
- **Beans**: Absorb maximum heat (moisture evaporation requires energy)
- **RoR**: Steady or declining (beans cool drum/air, absorb heat)
- **Roaster**: Must supply heat continuously
- **Energy Balance**: 100% endothermic (no heat generation)

**Roaster Control**:
- **Maintain Heat**: Drying requires consistent energy input
- **Don't Rush**: Adequate drying essential for even roast
- **Target**: Yellow color at 5-6 minutes typical

### Phase 2: Browning/Maillard (Transitional)

**Temperature**: ~350-390°F (177-199°C)  
**Duration**: 3-6 minutes  
**Energy**: Endothermic → Weakly Exothermic (Transition)

**What Happens**:
- **Maillard Reactions**: Amino acids + reducing sugars → browning, flavor compounds
- **Color**: Yellow → Light Brown → Medium Brown
- **Chemistry**: Complex reactions begin (Maillard dominant)
- **Smell**: Bread-like, baking, toasty, developing coffee aromas
- **Structural**: Cell walls weaken, beans expand slightly

**Heat Dynamics**:
- **Beans**: Still absorbing heat (endothermic dominant)
- **But**: Maillard reactions generate some heat (weakly exothermic)
- **RoR**: May slow or flatten (less endothermic than drying phase)
- **Transition**: Moving toward exothermic
- **Roaster**: Continue heat application, but less aggressive than drying

**Roaster Control**:
- **Heat Application**: Moderate increase to accelerate browning
- **Critical Phase**: Development of flavor precursors
- **Target**: First crack at 9-12 minutes total roast time

### Phase 3: First Crack & Development (Strongly Exothermic)

**Temperature**: ~390-410°F (199-210°C) at first crack start  
**Duration**: 1-4 minutes (development time)  
**Energy**: **Strongly Exothermic** ⚠️

**What Happens**:
- **First Crack**: Physical popping sound (beans crack/expand)
  - **Cause**: Pressure from steam and CO₂ ruptures cell walls
  - **Sound**: Popcorn-like popping, snapping
  - **Visual**: Beans expand, lighten slightly, chaff releases
- **Pyrolysis**: Thermal decomposition, sugar breakdown (exothermic)
- **CO₂ Production**: Massive CO₂ generation begins
- **Chemical Reactions**: Caramelization, pyrolysis, complex transformations
- **Heat Generation**: Beans produce own heat from reactions

**Heat Dynamics** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**:
- **Exothermic**: Beans generating significant heat
- **RoR Spike**: Temperature rise accelerates (beans heating themselves)
- **Runaway Risk**: Without heat reduction, beans can "crash" or runaway
- **Roaster Response**: **Reduce heat input** - beans making own heat now
- **Momentum**: Exothermic reactions create roast momentum
- **Control Challenge**: Managing self-generated heat

**Roaster Control** (Critical Phase):
- **Reduce Heat**: Lower burner, increase airflow (cool beans)
- **Monitor RoR**: Watch for spike, control with heat reduction
- **Development Time**: 60-180 seconds typical (variety and goal dependent)
- **Drop Decision**: When to end roast (roast level target)

**Chemistry**:
- **Caramelization**: Sugars break down → caramel flavors
- **Pyrolysis**: Thermal decomposition → roast flavors, CO₂, volatiles
- **Strecker Degradation**: Amino acids → aldehydes → roast aromas
- **Exothermic**: These reactions release energy

### Phase 4: Second Crack (Extremely Exothermic - Dark Roasts Only)

**Temperature**: ~425-435°F (218-224°C)  
**Duration**: Variable (only for dark roasts)  
**Energy**: **Extremely Exothermic**

**What Happens**:
- **Second Crack**: Faster, quieter popping (like Rice Krispies)
  - **Cause**: Cell wall structure fully breaks down
  - **Visual**: Oils emerge on bean surface
  - **Smoke**: Visible smoke production increases
- **Pyrolysis Intensifies**: Severe thermal breakdown
- **Oils Released**: Coffee oils migrate to surface
- **Color**: Dark brown → very dark brown → black

**Heat Dynamics**:
- **Very Exothermic**: Beans producing maximum heat
- **Runaway Risk**: High - reactions accelerate rapidly
- **Control**: Requires aggressive cooling or heat removal
- **Momentum**: Very difficult to slow once started

**For Dark Roasts Only**:
- French Roast, Italian Roast
- Most specialty coffee never reaches second crack
- High risk of fire if not controlled

## 📊 Rate of Rise (RoR) Explained

**RoR Definition**: Speed of temperature increase (degrees per time unit)

**Typical RoR Curve**:
1. **Charge to Turning Point**: RoR negative to zero (beans cool drum)
2. **Drying Phase**: RoR increases then gradually declines (endothermic)
3. **Browning Phase**: RoR continues declining (less endothermic)
4. **First Crack**: **RoR spikes upward** (exothermic heat generation)
5. **Development**: RoR declines from spike (heat management)

**Ideal RoR Pattern**:
- **Steady Decline**: Gradual RoR decrease through drying and browning
- **Controlled Spike at First Crack**: Moderate increase, then managed decline
- **No Flicking**: Sudden RoR increases/decreases indicate poor control
- **No Crash**: RoR doesn't plummet (under-developed, baked)

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### Managing the Exothermic Phase

**At First Crack Onset**:
1. **Listen**: First crack begins (popping sounds)
2. **Watch RoR**: Temperature rise accelerates
3. **Reduce Heat Immediately**: Lower burner 20-40%
4. **Increase Airflow** (if adjustable): Cool beans, remove heat
5. **Monitor Development**: Watch clock and temperature
6. **Target Drop Temp**: Plan when to end roast

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Continuing High Heat**: Causes runaway, scorching, over-roasting
- **Too Much Reduction**: Stalls roast, baking, under-development
- **Ignoring RoR**: Not monitoring leads to unpredictable roasts

**Goal**: Control exothermic phase, balance development time with temperature rise

## 📝 Summary

Understanding endothermic (heat-absorbing) and exothermic (heat-generating) phases in roasting is fundamental to roast control. The drying and browning phases require heat input (endothermic), while first crack and development involve beans generating own heat (exothermic) - requiring roasters to reduce heat application to prevent runaway roasting and achieve controlled development.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Drying**: Endothermic - supply heat, beans absorb
- **Browning**: Transitional - still mostly endothermic
- **First Crack**: Exothermic - **reduce heat**, beans self-heating
- **RoR**: Expect spike at first crack from exothermic reactions
- **Control**: Manage exothermic phase with heat reduction
- **Development**: Balance time with temperature rise
