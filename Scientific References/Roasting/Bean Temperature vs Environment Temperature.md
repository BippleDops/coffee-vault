# 🌡️ Bean vs Environment Temperature

**Category**: Roasting Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

---

## 📋 Overview

Bean temperature (BT) and environment temperature (ET) provide different information - BT measures actual bean temp (what matters for roast development) while ET measures air/drum temp (heat source). Understanding both enables better roast control.

**Two Measurements**:
- **Bean Temperature (BT)**: Probe in beans, measures actual bean temp
- **Environment Temp (ET)**: Measures air/drum temp, heat source

**Why Both Matter**:
- **BT**: What actually matters (bean development)
- **ET**: Heat available for transfer
- **Gap**: BT-ET gap indicates heat transfer efficiency

## 🔬 Measurement

**Bean Probe**: Thermocouple in bean mass  
**Environment Probe**: Measures air/drum temp  
**Difference**: ET higher than BT (heat transferring to beans)

## 📝 Summary

Bean temperature measures actual bean development (what matters); environment temperature measures heat source (drum/air temp). Both provide roast control information - BT for development tracking, ET for heat management.
