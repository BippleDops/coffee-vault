# 🔺 Triangle Testing for Coffee Discrimination

**Category**: Sensory Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Test ability to distinguish between coffees

---

## 📋 Overview

Triangle testing is sensory science's gold-standard discrimination methodology - presenting three samples (two identical, one different) to determine if taster can identify the odd one, enabling objective assessment of perceptual differences, sensory training, and quality control validation.

**What is Triangle Testing**:
- **Setup**: Three samples (A, A, B presented blind)
- **Task**: Identify which sample is different
- **Goal**: Determine if difference is perceptible
- **Statistical**: Results analyzed statistically for significance
- **Applications**: QC, sensory training, processing comparison, variety discrimination

**Why Use Triangle Testing**:
- **Objective**: Removes bias, forces pure sensory discrimination
- **Statistical**: Provides statistical significance (not subjective opinion)
- **Training**: Develops sensory acuity through practice
- **QC**: Validates roast consistency, quality maintenance
- **Research**: Determines if processing/variety changes are perceptible

**Standard in**:
- Q Grader certification (required skill)
- Sensory panel training
- Quality control programs
- Coffee research
- Competition preparation

## 🔬 Triangle Test Protocol

**Setup**:
1. **Prepare Samples**: 
   - Sample A (control): Two cups
   - Sample B (test): One cup
   - **Randomize**: A-A-B, A-B-A, or B-A-A order (random)

2. **Present Blind**:
   - Cups labeled 1, 2, 3 (no indication which is different)
   - Tester doesn't know order
   - **Randomization**: Different for each tester

3. **Task**:
   - Taste all three samples
   - Identify which is different (forced choice - must guess even if unsure)
   - **No "don't know"**: Must choose one

4. **Record**:
   - Correct or incorrect
   - Confidence level (optional)
   - Descriptors (optional)

**Statistical Analysis**:
- **Chance**: 33.3% correct by guessing
- **Significance**: Need >33.3% across multiple testers
- **Minimum Testers**: 20-30 for statistical power
- **Calculation**: Binomial probability determines if results significant

## 🎯 Applications

**Quality Control**:
- **Batch Consistency**: Is today's roast same as yesterday's?
- **Green Coffee**: Is this lot same quality as previous?
- **Storage**: Has coffee degraded over time?

**Sensory Training**:
- **Skill Development**: Practice discrimination
- **Calibration**: Train palate to detect subtle differences
- **Progress Tracking**: Measure sensory improvement

**Processing Comparison**:
- **Does processing matter?**: Washed vs. honey perceptibly different?
- **Fermentation Time**: 24hr vs. 48hr fermentation detectable?
- **Experimental**: Is anaerobic different from standard?

## 📝 Summary

Triangle testing is sensory science's objective discrimination method - three samples (two identical, one different) determining if differences are perceptible. It provides statistical validation, trains sensory skills, and enables quality control through forced-choice discrimination task.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Setup**: A-A-B configuration, randomized, blind
- **Task**: Identify different sample (forced choice)
- **Statistics**: Results analyzed for significance (>33.3% chance)
- **Applications**: QC, training, research, processing validation
- **Professional**: Standard method in coffee industry
