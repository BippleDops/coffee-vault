## 📊 The Cupping Process

### Step 1: Sample Preparation (0-5 minutes)

**Dry Evaluation**:
1. Measure 8.25g of whole bean coffee
2. Observe whole bean appearance: color, uniformity, defects
3. Grind coffee immediately before cupping
4. Pour grounds into cupping bowl
5. Set up 2-3 bowls per sample (for consistency checking)

**Fragrance Assessment**:
1. Immediately smell dry grounds in bowl
2. Gently shake bowl to release aromatics
3. Note intensity and character of dry fragrance
4. Assess complexity and quality
5. Score **Fragrance/Aroma** (1-10 scale)

*Descriptors*: Floral, fruity, nutty, chocolatey, spicy, herbal, etc.

### Step 2: Adding Water (5-10 minutes)

**Wet Evaluation**:
1. Heat water to exactly 200°F (93°C)
2. Start timer
3. Pour water directly onto grounds
4. Fill bowl to rim (150ml total water)
5. Immediately assess wet aroma
6. Do NOT disturb crust yet

**Aroma Assessment**:
1. Lean over bowl and inhale deeply
2. Note how aroma changes from dry to wet
3. Assess intensity, complexity, quality
4. Compare across samples
5. Update **Fragrance/Aroma** score if needed

*Tip*: Wet aroma often reveals more complexity than dry fragrance

### Step 3: Crust Break (4 minutes steep time)

**Breaking the Crust**:
1. At exactly 4:00 minutes, prepare to break crust
2. Position nose close to bowl surface
3. Use cupping spoon to gently push crust from far side toward you
4. Break crust in 3 deliberate strokes
5. Inhale deeply as aromatics release
6. This is peak aroma intensity!

**Skim the Surface**:
1. After breaking crust on all samples, return to first bowl
2. Use two spoons to skim foam and grounds from surface
3. Remove as much floating material as possible
4. Clean spoons between samples
5. Final aroma assessment

**Scoring**:
- Update **Fragrance/Aroma** with final score
- Note any defects observed during breaking

### Step 4: First Tasting (13-15 minutes after pour)

**Slurping Technique**:
1. Allow coffee to cool to ~160°F (71°C) - about 13-15 minutes
2. Dip spoon into liquid, collecting generous amount
3. Bring spoon to lips
4. Slurp forcefully to aspirate liquid across entire palate
5. "Spray" coffee across tongue and roof of mouth
6. Hold briefly, then expectorate into spittoon

**Why Slurp?**
- Aerates coffee, releasing volatile aromatics
- Distributes liquid across entire tongue
- Engages retronasal olfaction
- Cools coffee as it enters mouth

**Initial Assessment Categories**:

**Flavor** (1-10):
- Primary taste: What do you taste?
- Complexity: Simple or multi-layered?
- Quality: Pleasant, distinctive, clean?

**Aftertaste** (1-10):
- Length: How long do flavors persist?
- Quality: Pleasant or unpleasant lingering?
- Evolution: Do flavors develop or fade quickly?

**Acidity** (1-10):
- Intensity: How bright?
- Quality: Crisp, bright, or sour, sharp?
- Type: Citric, malic, phosphoric, acetic?

**Body** (1-10):
- Weight: Light, medium, full?
- Texture: Silky, creamy, syrupy, watery?
- Mouthfeel: Coating, tongue weight?

### Step 5: Second Tasting (20-22 minutes after pour)

**As Coffee Cools to ~140°F (60°C)**:

Flavors develop and change as coffee cools. Reassess:

1. **Taste all samples again at this temperature**
2. **Confirm or adjust scores** based on evolution
3. **Note consistency** across multiple bowls of same sample
4. **Assess Balance**: How well do components harmonize?

**Balance** (1-10):
- Harmony: Do acidity, sweetness, body complement?
- Integration: Are flavors unified or disjointed?
- Completeness: Well-rounded or one-dimensional?

**Sweetness** (1-10 or points):
- Intensity: How much perceived sweetness?
- Quality: Honey, caramel, sugar, fruit sweetness?
- Clean: Or is bitterness/sourness masking?

Note: SCA scoring system gives 2 points per cup for Clean Cup, Sweetness, and Uniformity (across multiple bowls)

### Step 6: Final Tasting (25-30 minutes after pour)

**At ~130°F (54°C) or Room Temperature**:

Final assessment as coffee reaches optimal tasting temperature:

1. **Make final assessments of all attributes**
2. **Confirm consistency across sample bowls**
3. **Finalize all scores**
4. **Note any defects** that become apparent
5. **Calculate final score**

**Additional Attributes**:

**Clean Cup** (2 points):
- Free from defects?
- No off-flavors or taints?
- Transparent flavors?

**Uniformity** (2 points):
- Are all cups of same sample consistent?
- Check all 3-5 bowls
- Penalty for inconsistency

**Overall** (1-10):
- Your holistic assessment
- Does this coffee excite you?
- Would you want to drink this?
- "The gestalt"

## 📝 Scoring Tips

### Calibration Guidelines

**7.5 is "Average" Specialty**:
- Use 7.5 as your baseline for acceptable specialty coffee
- Score relative to this baseline
- Reserve 9+ for truly exceptional attributes

**Differentiate Quality from Intensity**:
- High acidity intensity doesn't mean high acidity quality
- Separate how much from how good

**Use Half Points**:
- 0.25 increments allowed
- Increases precision
- Helps differentiate similar samples

**Be Consistent**:
- Use same reference points across session
- Cup same samples weekly for calibration
- Practice with experienced cuppers
