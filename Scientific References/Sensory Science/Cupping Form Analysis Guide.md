# Coffee Cupping Form Analysis Guide

## Overview

The SCA cupping form is the industry standard for scoring coffee quality. Understanding each section and scoring criteria enables accurate assessment and consistent evaluation.

## Form Structure

**Total Score**: 0-100 points

**Components**:
- Primary Attributes: 10 scores @ 6-10 points = 60-100 pts
- Clean Cup: 2 pts × 5 cups = 10 pts max
- Sweetness: 2 pts × 5 cups = 10 pts max  
- Uniformity: 2 pts × 5 cups = 10 pts max
- Defects: Subtract 2 or 4 points
- **Total**: Sum all components

## Primary Attributes (6.0-10.0 Each)

### 1. Fragrance/Aroma

**Fragrance** (Dry): Smell ground coffee
**Aroma** (Wet): Smell after adding water and breaking crust

**Scoring**:
- Intensity and quality both matter
- Complexity adds points
- Clean, distinct = higher scores
- Lack of defects important

**Range**:
- 6.0-6.75: Below specialty
- 7.0-7.75: Good
- 8.0-8.75: Very good
- 9.0-10.0: Excellent

### 2. Flavor

**Evaluation**: Primary taste and flavor impression

**Scoring Factors**:
- Clarity and distinction
- Complexity and depth
- Pleasant character
- Origin typicity

**Common Descriptors Integration**:
- Identify specific flavors
- Note on form
- Contributes to final score

### 3. Aftertaste

**Evaluation**: Finish after spitting/swallowing

**Scoring Factors**:
- Length (duration of finish)
- Quality (pleasant vs unpleasant)
- Clarity
- Sweetness in finish

**Range**:
- Short, neutral: 7.0
- Medium, pleasant: 8.0
- Long, sweet, complex: 9.0+

### 4. Acidity

**Evaluation**: Brightness, liveliness

**Scoring Factors**:
- Intensity (noted separately)
- Quality (scored)
- Type (citric, malic, etc.)
- Balance with other attributes

**Quality Descriptors**:
- 9.0+: Vibrant, bright, complex
- 8.0-8.75: Pleasant, balanced
- 7.0-7.75: Moderate
- <7.0: Lacking or unpleasant

### 5. Body

**Evaluation**: Tactile mouthfeel, weight, texture

**Scoring Factors**:
- Weight (light to full)
- Texture (smooth to astringent)
- Quality
- Appropriateness to origin

**Not Linear**:
- Light body can score 9.0 if excellent quality
- Full body can score 7.0 if coarse
- Quality > quantity

### 6. Balance

**Evaluation**: Harmony of all attributes

**Scoring Factors**:
- No attribute dominates negatively
- Acidity, body, flavor work together
- Nothing missing
- Overall integration

**High Scores**:
- All attributes present and pleasant
- Nothing overwhelming
- Complete experience

### 7. Sweetness (Checkbox)

**Evaluation**: Sweetness presence in each of 5 cups

**Scoring**:
- 2 points per cup showing sweetness
- Max 10 points (all 5 cups sweet)

**What is Sweetness**:
- Pleasant, round fullness
- Absence of harsh notes
- Positive impression
- Not just sugar

### 8. Clean Cup (Checkbox)

**Evaluation**: Freedom from defects in each cup

**Scoring**:
- 2 points per clean cup
- Max 10 points (all 5 cups clean)

**Defect = 0 Points for That Cup**:
- Any off-flavor
- Ferment, sour, phenolic
- Earthy, moldy
- Taints

### 9. Uniformity (Checkbox)

**Evaluation**: Consistency across 5 cups

**Scoring**:
- 2 points per cup matching others
- Max 10 points (all identical)

**Variation = 0 Points**:
- Different flavor in any cup
- Intensity variation
- Defect in some but not all

### 10. Overall

**Evaluation**: Holistic assessment

**Scoring**:
- Your overall impression
- Would you want to drink this?
- Considering all factors
- Personal professional judgment

**NOT Simple Average**:
- Can exceed component scores
- Or fall below
- Accounts for intangibles
- Experience-driven

## Defects Section

**Taint** (Intensity 2-4): -2 per cup
**Fault** (Intensity 6+): -4 per cup

**Intensity Levels**:
- 2: Slight defect
- 4: Moderate defect  
- 6: Definite defect (Fault)
- 8: Strong defect
- 10: Severe defect

## Final Score Calculation

**Example**:
```
Fragrance/Aroma: 8.0
Flavor: 8.25
Aftertaste: 8.0
Acidity: 8.5
Body: 8.0
Balance: 8.0
Sweetness: 10 (all 5 cups)
Clean Cup: 10 (all 5 cups)
Uniformity: 10 (all 5 cups)
Overall: 8.5
Defects: 0

Total: 87.25 points (Very Good)
```

## Score Interpretation

**Specialty Grade**: ≥80.00
**Premium**: 85.00-89.99 (Very Good)
**Excellent**: 90.00-94.99
**Outstanding**: ≥95.00

**Below 80**:
- Not specialty grade
- Commercial quality
- Commodity pricing

## Scoring Calibration

### Reference Points

**6.0**: Minimum acceptable (barely specialty)
**7.0**: Fair, average specialty
**8.0**: Good, typical specialty
**9.0**: Very good, premium
**10.0**: Perfect, almost never given

### Increment Meaning

**0.25 Steps**:
- Meaningful differences
- Not arbitrary
- Calibrated perception
- Justified by cupper

## Common Scoring Pitfalls

**Score Inflation**:
- Giving 9s and 10s too freely
- Recalibrate with references
- Remember 8.0 is good

**Inconsistent Intensity/Quality**:
- High intensity ≠ high score
- Quality matters more
- Separate evaluation

**Bias**:
- Knowing origin affects scoring
- Cup blind when possible
- Trust sensory, not expectations

## Form Variations
