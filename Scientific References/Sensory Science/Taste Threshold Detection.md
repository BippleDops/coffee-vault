# 👅 Taste Threshold Detection

**Category**: Sensory Science  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand sensory thresholds and detection limits

---

## 📋 Overview

Taste thresholds (minimum concentration detectable) vary dramatically between individuals - with trained tasters having lower thresholds (higher sensitivity) than untrained, explaining why some people detect subtle flavors others miss and why sensory training improves detection ability.

**What is Threshold**:
- **Definition**: Minimum concentration detectable by taste/smell
- **Individual Variation**: 10-100x variation between people
- **Training**: Lowers thresholds (improves sensitivity)
- **Age**: Generally decreases with age (higher thresholds)

**Why Thresholds Matter**:
- **Flavor Detection**: Determines what flavors perceived
- **Quality Control**: Low thresholds detect defects earlier
- **Training**: Measures sensory improvement
- **Professional**: Q Grader tests threshold detection

## 🔬 Threshold Types

**Detection Threshold**:
- **Definition**: Minimum to detect presence (something vs. nothing)
- **Lowest**: Can detect but not identify

**Recognition Threshold**:
- **Definition**: Minimum to identify what it is
- **Higher**: Must be stronger to name flavor

**Difference Threshold**:
- **Definition**: Minimum difference detectable between two samples
- **Application**: Quality control, consistency checking

## 🎯 Training Effects

**Untrained Tasters**:
- High thresholds (less sensitive)
- Wide individual variation
- Miss subtle flavors

**Trained Tasters**:
- Lower thresholds (more sensitive)
- More consistent
- Detect subtle notes

**Training**: Regular exposure, practice lowers thresholds (improves sensitivity)

## 📝 Summary

Taste thresholds (minimum detectable concentration) vary 10-100x between individuals - trained tasters have lower thresholds (higher sensitivity) than untrained through regular exposure and practice. Understanding thresholds explains flavor detection differences and why sensory training improves coffee tasting ability.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Threshold**: Minimum detectable concentration
- **Variation**: 10-100x between individuals
- **Training**: Lowers thresholds, improves sensitivity
- **Types**: Detection, recognition, difference thresholds
- **Professional**: Q Grader tests threshold detection
