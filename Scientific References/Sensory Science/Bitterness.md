# ☕ Bitterness

**Category**: Sensory Science → Taste Perception  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Related**: [[Perceived Acidity]], [[Organic Acids]], [[Quinic Acid]], [[Roasting Science]]

---

## 📋 Overview

**Bitterness** is one of coffee's fundamental taste qualities, resulting from roasting, extraction, and chemical composition. When balanced, it contributes complexity; when excessive, it dominates and reduces quality. Understanding bitterness sources enables better roasting, brewing, and quality evaluation.

**Key Insight**: Not all bitterness is the same - quality bitterness is rich and pleasant, while poor bitterness is harsh and astringent.

## 🔬 Chemical Sources

**Primary Bitterness Compounds**:

1. **Roast-Derived**:
   - [[Maillard Reaction Pathways|Maillard reaction]] products
   - Caramelization compounds
   - [[Quinic Acid]] (from roasting)
   - Quinic acid lactones (staling)

2. **Phenolic Compounds**:
   - [[Chlorogenic Acids and Antioxidants|Chlorogenic acids]] (raw, astringent)
   - Polyphenols (antioxidants)
   - Lignin breakdown products

3. **Extraction-Related**:
   - Over-extracted compounds
   - Tannins (astringency)
   - Bitter alkaloids (caffeine contributes)

## 🎯 Quality vs. Defect Bitterness

**Quality Bitterness** (Desirable):
- **Character**: Rich, dark chocolate, cocoa
- **Balance**: Complements sweetness, acidity
- **Source**: Appropriate roasting, balanced extraction
- **Perception**: Pleasant, adds complexity
- **Application**: Espresso, dark roasts, milk drinks

**Defect Bitterness** (Undesirable):
- **Character**: Harsh, astringent, metallic
- **Balance**: Dominates, overwhelms other flavors
- **Source**: Over-roasting, over-extraction, staling
- **Perception**: Unpleasant, reduces quality
- **Application**: None - defect to fix

## 🔥 Roasting Impact

**Light Roast**:
- **Bitterness**: Low (minimal roast development)
- **Source**: Mainly from [[Chlorogenic Acids and Antioxidants|chlorogenic acids]]
- **Character**: Astringent, raw (if underdeveloped)
- **Balance**: Bright acidity dominant

**Medium Roast**:
- **Bitterness**: Moderate, balanced
- **Source**: Developing Maillard products
- **Character**: Pleasant, cocoa-like
- **Balance**: Well-integrated with acidity/sweetness

**Dark Roast**:
- **Bitterness**: High, dominant
- **Source**: Extensive Maillard, [[Quinic Acid|quinic acid]]
- **Character**: Rich, dark, potentially harsh
- **Balance**: Bitterness dominant, less bright

## 💧 Extraction Impact

**Under-Extraction**:
- **Bitterness**: Low
- **Character**: Sour, salty, flat
- **Cause**: Insufficient contact time
- **Fix**: Longer brew, finer grind, higher temp

**Optimal Extraction**:
- **Bitterness**: Balanced
- **Character**: Pleasant, cocoa-like (if present)
- **Source**: Appropriate development
- **Result**: Complexity without harshness

**Over-Extraction**:
- **Bitterness**: High, harsh
- **Character**: Astringent, drying, unpleasant
- **Cause**: Too much contact, too fine, too hot
- **Fix**: Shorter brew, coarser grind, lower temp

## 🌡️ Water Temperature Effect

**Higher Temperature (95-100°C)**:
- Extracts more bitter compounds
- Can extract phenolic bitterness
- Especially affects dark roasts
- Risk of harsh over-extraction

**Lower Temperature (85-92°C)**:
- Extracts fewer bitter compounds
- Smoother, less harsh
- Good for darker roasts
- Can under-extract light roasts

## 🌍 Origin Differences

**Higher Bitterness Potential**:
- **Robusta**: Higher chlorogenic, more bitter
- **Lower altitude**: Less refined
- **Some varietals**: Inherent bitterness

**Lower Bitterness Potential**:
- **High-altitude Arabica**: More refined
- **Washed process**: Cleaner
- **Premium varietals**: Balanced profiles

## 📊 Sensory Evaluation

**Positive Bitterness**:
- Dark chocolate, cocoa
- Nuts, roasted notes
- Pleasant, rich
- Well-balanced
- Adds complexity

**Negative Bitterness**:
- Harsh, astringent
- Metallic, medicinal
- Mouth-drying
- Unpleasant, dominating
- Sign of defect

**Tasting**:
- Distinguish quality vs. defect
- Identify source (roast vs. extraction)
- Evaluate balance
- Calibrate perception
