# Advanced Cupping Techniques

## Overview

Beyond basic cupping, advanced techniques enable deeper analysis, precise differentiation, and professional-level quality assessment.

## Advanced Protocols

### Descriptive Analysis

**Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA)**:
- Rate intensity of specific attributes
- Use reference standards
- Precise numerical scoring
- Research applications

**Procedure**:
1. Identify attributes present
2. Rate each on 0-15 scale
3. Use calibrated references
4. Statistical analysis of results

### Difference Testing

**Paired Comparison**:
- Two samples
- Which is more intense for specific attribute?
- Statistical validity
- Preference testing

**Triangle Test** (Advanced):
- Three samples (AAB or ABB)
- Identify odd sample
- Multiple attributes
- Professional calibration

### Ranking Tests

**Procedure**:
- 5-10 samples
- Rank by specific attribute
- Or overall preference
- Statistical analysis

**Applications**:
- Roast profile optimization
- Processing method comparison
- Quality ranking

## Micro-Lot Evaluation

**High-Value Assessment**:
- Ultra-premium lots
- Detailed evaluation
- Multiple cuppers
- Blind protocols
- Competition standards

**Scoring**:
- 0.25 point increments meaningful
- 90+ scores justified
- Defect intolerance
- Excellence standards

## Roast Evaluation

**Roast-to-Cupping**:
- Standard sample roast
- Consistent profile for all samples
- Evaluate green quality
- Independent of roasting skill

**Roast Level Comparison**:
- Same coffee, multiple roast levels
- Identify optimal development
- Profile refinement
- Customer preference

## Temporal Evaluation

**Hot to Cool**:
- Cup immediately (fragrance/aroma)
- 8-10 min (standard cupping temp)
- 15-20 min (cooler, different character)
- 30+ min (final assessment)

**Changes**:
- Acidity perception shifts
- Sweetness evolves
- Defects more apparent when cool
- Complete character revealed

## Practical Applications

**For Q Graders**: Calibration maintenance
**For Roasters**: Profile optimization
**For Buyers**: Precise quality assessment
**For Researchers**: Systematic analysis
