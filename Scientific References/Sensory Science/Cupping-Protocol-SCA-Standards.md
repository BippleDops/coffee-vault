# SCA Cupping Protocol: Standardized Coffee Evaluation Methodology

## Overview

The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) Cupping Protocol provides standardized methodology for coffee sensory evaluation, enabling consistent, reproducible assessment across regions, roasters, and quality control labs worldwide. Developed through decades of industry consensus and scientific validation, the protocol specifies exact parameters—8-12g coffee per 150mL water, 200°F (93°C) water temperature, 4-minute steep before evaluation, 10-attribute scoring system—that minimize variability and enable meaningful comparison. Understanding and implementing SCA standards transforms subjective tasting into calibrated, professional-quality assessment.

The protocol's power lies in controlling variables that affect sensory perception: grind size (70-75% passing 20-mesh sieve), water quality (TDS 125-175 ppm, neutral pH), sample roasting (Agtron 58±1 for Arabica, 8-12 minutes to first crack), and evaluation timing (8-10 minutes after brewing for optimal temperature). These specifications, combined with the standardized cupping form (10 quality attributes scored 6-10 scale, weighted final score), enable Q-Grader certification, competition judging, and international coffee trading based on objective quality assessment.

Practical implementation requires understanding the scientific rationale behind each specification, maintaining calibrated equipment (scales, timers, thermometers), and regular protocol training to prevent drift. Mastering SCA cupping enables participation in professional evaluation, provides baseline for personal cupping modifications, and ensures results align with global specialty coffee industry standards.

## Key Concepts

### Core Protocol Parameters

**Coffee preparation**:
- **Sample size**: 8.25g coffee per 150mL water (1:18.18 ratio)
- **Alternative**: 12g per 200mL, 8g per 140mL (maintain 1:18 ratio)
- **Grind**: Medium (70-75% passing US #20 sieve / 0.85mm)
- **Timing**: Evaluate within 15 minutes of grinding (aroma loss)

**Water specifications**:
- **Temperature**: 200°F (93°C) at point of contact
- **Quality**: 125-175 ppm TDS, odor-free, pH 7.0 (neutral)

- **Cooling**: Within 4 minutes of roast completion
- **Rest**: 8-24 hours before cupping (CO2 degassing)

### SCA Cupping Form Attributes

**10 evaluated attributes** (scored 6-10, 0.25 increments):

**1. Fragrance/Aroma** (dry/wet):
- **Fragrance**: Dry grounds aroma (pre-water)
- **Aroma**: Wet grounds/crust aroma (post-water)
- **Score**: Intensity + quality + complexity

**2. Flavor**:
- **Definition**: Mid-palate impression (taste + aroma)
- **Evaluation**: Dominant flavor notes, intensity, pleasantness
- **Score**: Positive flavor characteristics

**3. Aftertaste**:
- **Definition**: Finish length and quality
- **Evaluation**: 8-15 seconds post-expectoration
- **Score**: Clarity, sweetness, pleasantness of finish

**4. Acidity**:
- **Definition**: Brightness, liveliness (not sourness)
- **Evaluation**: Intensity + quality + type
- **Score**: Positive acidity (malic, citric) scored higher

**5. Body**:
- **Definition**: Tactile mouthfeel, weight, viscosity
- **Evaluation**: Texture from light to heavy
- **Score**: Quality and intensity of mouthfeel

**6. Balance**:
- **Definition**: Harmony of flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body
- **Evaluation**: How attributes complement each other
- **Score**: Integration and synergy

**7. Sweetness** (intensity):
- **Definition**: Pleasant fullness, lack of harsh defects
- **Evaluation**: Presence of sweet taste and aromatics
- **Score**: 2 points per cup (5 cups = 10 points possible)

**8. Clean Cup** (intensity):
- **Definition**: Lack of off-flavors from first ingestion to aftertaste
- **Evaluation**: Absence of defects, taints
- **Score**: 2 points per cup (5 cups = 10 points possible)

**9. Uniformity** (intensity):
- **Definition**: Consistency across 5 cups
- **Evaluation**: Similarity of flavor intensity and character
- **Score**: 2 points per cup if consistent

**10. Overall**:
- **Definition**: Cupper's holistic assessment
- **Evaluation**: Personal rating of coffee quality
- **Score**: Individual cupper preference and experience

**Defects** (subtract from total):
- **Taint** (2-4 points): Off-flavor in 1-3 cups
- **Fault** (4 points): Off-flavor in 3+ cups or severe defect

**Final Score** (sum of all attributes):
- **90-100**: Outstanding specialty
- **85-89.99**: Excellent specialty
- **80-84.99**: Very good specialty
- **<80**: Below specialty grade

### Evaluation Timing

**Temperature-dependent evaluation**:

**Hot (>60°C, 140°F+)**:
- **Attribute**: Fragrance/Aroma, First Flavor impression
- **Timing**: 0-3 minutes after pour
- **Characteristics**: Aromatic volatiles peak, initial taste

**Warm (40-60°C, 104-140°F)**:
- **Attributes**: Flavor, Acidity, Sweetness, Aftertaste
- **Timing**: 8-12 minutes after pour
- **Optimal**: Best temperature for balanced evaluation

**Cool (20-40°C, 68-104°F)**:
- **Attributes**: Body, Balance, Overall re-assessment
- **Timing**: 15-25 minutes after pour
- **Reveals**: True sweetness, balance, underlying defects

**Protocol**: Evaluate all samples at each temperature phase (hot → warm → cool).

## The Science

### Why 93°C Water?

**Extraction kinetics**:
- **93°C**: Optimal extraction rate for cupping (3-5 min contact)
- **Higher** (100°C): Over-extraction risk, volatilizes delicate aromatics
- **Lower** (<90°C): Under-extraction, incomplete flavor development

**Standardization**:
- **Boiling** (100°C at sea level): Variable with altitude
- **200°F** (93.3°C): Consistent target regardless of elevation
- **Tolerance**: ±2°C acceptable (91-95°C)

### Grind Size Specification

**70-75% passing 20-mesh** (0.85mm):
- **Rationale**: Balance extraction rate with brew time
- **Too fine**: Over-extraction in 4 minutes, high bitterness
- **Too coarse**: Under-extraction, muted flavors
- **Standardization**: Reproducible across different grinders

**Particle size distribution**:
- Some fines (fast extraction)
- Some boulders (slow extraction)
- **Result**: Broad extraction in short time (comprehensive flavor profile)

### Why 8-24 Hour Rest?

**CO2 degassing**:
- **Immediately post-roast**: 1.0-1.2% CO2 by weight
- **8 hours**: ~0.8% CO2 (adequate degassing)
- **24 hours**: ~0.6% CO2 (optimal for cupping)
- **48+ hours**: Aroma loss begins

**Fresh vs. rested**:
- **Too fresh** (<8h): Excessive CO2 interferes, harsh notes
- **Optimal** (8-24h): Clean evaluation, stable characteristics
- **Old** (48+h): Oxidation, aroma loss, not representative

## Practical Applications

### Setting Up Cupping Lab

**Equipment checklist**:
- **Cupping bowls**: 5-6 oz (150-180mL), tempered glass or ceramic
- **Scale**: 0.1g precision
- **Grinder**: Capable of medium grind, calibrated to 70-75% passing 20-mesh
- **Kettle**: Temperature control (93°C), gooseneck helpful
- **Cupping spoons**: Deep bowl, stainless steel
- **Spittoon**: One per cupper
- **Water**: Pitcher with SCA-spec water (125-175 ppm TDS)
- **Timer**: Digital, visible to all cuppers
- **Forms**: Printed SCA cupping forms or digital equivalent

**Sample roasting** (reference):
- **Roaster**: Sample roaster (100-300g capacity)
- **Profile**: 8-12 minutes to FC, light-medium development
- **Color**: Target Agtron 58 (Arabica), measure with colorimeter
- **Consistency**: ±1 Agtron across batches

### Conducting SCA Cupping Session

**Pre-session** (30 min before):
- Grind samples (one at a time, clean grinder between)
- Set up bowls (3-5 per coffee, label)
- Dose 8.25g into each bowl
- Boil water to 200°F (93°C)
- Warm spoons

**Dry evaluation** (0-3 min):
- Smell dry grounds (fragrance)
- Score fragrance (complexity, intensity, quality)

**Brew** (minute 0):
- Pour 150mL water directly onto grounds
- Start timer
- Ensure all grounds saturated

**Wet evaluation** (3-5 min):
- Smell wet crust (aroma)
- Score aroma

**Break crust** (minute 4):
- Insert spoon, stir gently 3 times
- Nose close to bowl (capture released aromatics)
- Final aroma score

**Skimming** (minute 5-6):
- Remove foam/floaters with two spoons
- Clean surface for tasting

**Tasting** (minute 8-25):
- **Hot** (8-10 min): Initial flavor, acidity impressions
- **Warm** (12-15 min): Sweetness, flavor depth, aftertaste, clean cup, uniformity
- **Cool** (18-25 min): Body, balance, overall reassessment

**Scoring**:
- Mark attributes on form during appropriate temperature
- Calculate final score (sum attributes - defects)
- Discuss as group (calibration)

### Common Protocol Modifications

**Home cupping**:
- **Simplified**: 3 attributes (flavor, acidity, body) instead of 10
- **Flexible water**: Tap water acceptable if odor-free
- **Simplified roast**: Home roaster, light-medium target
- **Result**: Captures 80% of benefit with 30% effort

**Competition cupping** (COE, national championships):
- **Stricter**: Exact Agtron 58±0.5
- **Blind**: Samples coded, cuppers don't know origin
- **Multiple rounds**: Preliminary, semi-final, final
- **Consensus**: Average of 3+ certified judges

**QC cupping** (roaster/importer):
- **Arrival cupping**: Verify green bean quality (defect check)
- **Pre-shipment**: Approve export lots
- **Roast development**: Optimize roast profiles
- **Batch QC**: Every roast batch or sample frequency

## Common Misconceptions

### "SCA protocol is only for competitions"

**Reality**: Protocol provides baseline for any cupping. Use full protocol for professional work, simplified versions for casual tasting. Benefits all skill levels.

### "You must score 0.25 increments precisely"

**Reality**: 0.25 increments provide granularity but beginners can use 0.5 or 1.0 increments. Precision develops with practice and calibration.

### "Higher score always means better coffee for you"

**Reality**: SCA score measures objective quality (defect-free, complexity, balance). Personal preference may differ—87-point washed Kenya might not suit someone preferring 84-point natural Brazil.

### "All cuppers should score identically"

**Reality**: Individual variation is expected (±2-3 points). Calibration reduces variation but perfect agreement is impossible and unnecessary. Trends matter more than absolute scores.

### "SCA protocol is too restrictive for creativity"

**Reality**: Protocol provides standardized baseline. After mastering, customize for specific needs (different ratio, temperature, evaluation focus) with informed understanding.

## Summary

- **SCA protocol specifies 8.25g coffee per 150mL water at 93°C**: 1:18.18 ratio with 70-75% passing 20-mesh grind, 4-minute steep before crust break—controls variables for reproducible evaluation
- **10-attribute scoring system (6-10 scale, 0.25 increments)**: Fragrance/Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Sweetness, Clean Cup, Uniformity, Overall—weighted final score (90-100 = outstanding, 85-89.99 = excellent, 80-84.99 = very good)
- **Temperature-phased evaluation reveals different attributes**: Hot (>60°C) = aromatics/first flavor; warm (40-60°C) = acidity/sweetness/aftertaste; cool (20-40°C) = body/balance/underlying defects
- **Reference roast at Agtron 58±1 for Arabica**: 8-12 minutes to first crack, light-medium development—standardizes roast variable across evaluations worldwide
- **8-24 hour post-roast rest optimal**: Adequate CO2 degassing (from 1.0% to 0.6-0.8%) without oxidative aroma loss—too fresh interferes, too old misrepresents
- **Water quality specification critical**: 125-175 ppm TDS, neutral pH 7.0, odor-free—mineral content affects extraction and flavor expression significantly
- **Defects subtract from final score**: Taint (off-flavor in 1-3 cups) = -2 to -4 points; Fault (3+ cups or severe) = -4 points—penalizes inconsistency and defects
