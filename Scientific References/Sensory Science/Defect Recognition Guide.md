# Coffee Defect Recognition Guide

## Overview

Recognizing coffee defects is essential for quality control, cupping, and coffee purchasing. Understanding common defects helps identify their causes and avoid poor-quality coffee.

## Categories of Defects

### Primary Defects (Severe)

**Black Beans**:
- Cause: Over-fermentation or insect damage
- Appearance: Completely black beans
- Impact: Sour, fermented flavors
- Cup: Ruins entire batch (even 1 bean)

**Sour Beans**:
- Cause: Premature picking or poor fermentation
- Appearance: Yellowish, wrinkled
- Impact: Acetic, sour notes
- Cup: Multiple beans taint batch

**Fungus Damage**:
- Cause: Mold during growth or storage
- Appearance: Moldy, discolored
- Impact: Musty, moldy, earthy defect flavors
- Cup: Mycotoxins possible (health concern)

### Secondary Defects (Moderate)

**Insect Damage**:
- Cause: Coffee Berry Borer
- Appearance: Small holes in beans
- Impact: Sour notes, fermented character
- Cup: Proportional to damage extent

**Partial Sour**:
- Cause: Partial fermentation
- Appearance: Part of bean discolored
- Impact: Off-notes
- Cup: Affects quality

**Floaters**:
- Cause: Underdeveloped beans, disease
- Appearance: Light, float in water
- Impact: Immature flavors
- Cup: Grassy, papery

## Flavor Defect Recognition

### Phenolic

**Descriptor**: Medicinal, band-aid, iodine

**Causes**:
- Rio/Rioy (bacterial infection - Brazil specific)
- Water quality issues during processing
- Chemical contamination

**Severity**: Severe defect
**Recognition**: Unmistakable chemical smell

### Fermented/Sour

**Descriptor**: Vinegar, acetic, sour milk, rotten

**Causes**:
- Over-fermentation during processing
- Unripe cherry fermentation
- Poor drying (continued fermentation)
- Damaged cherries

**Severity**: Severe
**Recognition**: Sharp sour smell, acetic notes

### Earthy/Musty

**Descriptor**: Soil, mold, must, basement

**Causes**:
- Storage mold
- Ground contact during drying
- Poor storage conditions
- Potato defect (microbial)

**Severity**: Moderate to severe
**Recognition**: Musty, dank smell

### Potato Defect

**Descriptor**: Raw potato, earthy

**Causes**:
- Bacterial infection (Pseudomonas)
- Specific to East African coffees
- Unpredictable
- Can appear in premium coffees

**Severity**: Severe (ruins cup)
**Recognition**: Distinct raw potato smell

### Faded

**Descriptor**: Cardboard, paper, stale

**Causes**:
- Old crop (aged green coffee)
- Poor storage
- Moisture exposure
- Oxidation

**Severity**: Moderate
**Recognition**: Flat, papery smell and taste

### Baggy/Jute

**Descriptor**: Burlap, hemp, musty

**Causes**:
- Storage in jute bags too long
- Moisture absorption
- Bag contamination

**Severity**: Mild to moderate
**Recognition**: Jute bag smell transferred

## Roast Defects

### Underdeveloped/Grassy

**Descriptor**: Grass, hay, green, raw

**Causes**:
- Insufficient roast development
- Dropped too early
- Too fast roast
- Inadequate Maillard phase

**Severity**: Moderate
**Recognition**: Grassy, vegetal smell

### Baked

**Descriptor**: Bread, flat, dull, lifeless

**Causes**:
- Stalled roast development
- Temperature plateau
- Too-slow roast
- Poor heat management

**Severity**: Moderate
**Recognition**: Flat smell, lacks complexity

### Scorched

**Descriptor**: Burnt, acrid, ashy

**Causes**:
- Excessive heat
- Poor agitation (beans stuck to drum)
- Too-high charge temperature

**Severity**: Moderate to severe
**Recognition**: Burnt smell, visible dark spots

### Tipped

**Descriptor**: Slight burnt notes at bean ends

**Causes**:
- Too-hot charge temperature
- Thin bean ends overheat
- Poor heat distribution

**Severity**: Mild (visual more than flavor)
**Recognition**: Darkened bean tips

## Processing Defects

### Stinker

**Descriptor**: Rotten, putrid, fecal

**Causes**:
- Single rotted bean
- Insect damage with decomposition
- Extreme fermentation in single bean

**Severity**: Catastrophic (1 bean ruins 10kg+)
**Recognition**: Unmistakable rotten smell

### Quaker

**Descriptor**: Peanutty, raw, papery

**Causes**:
- Underdeveloped bean
- Didn't ripen properly
- Genetic or environmental

**Severity**: Mild per bean, but common
**Recognition**: Light color after roasting (doesn't brown)

### Over-Fermentation

**Descriptor**: Vinegary, alcoholic, fermented fruit

**Causes**:
- Excessive fermentation time
- Poor temperature control
- Anaerobic/extended fermentation too long

**Severity**: Moderate to severe
**Recognition**: Alcohol or vinegar smell

## Visual Defect Recognition

### Green Beans

**Inspect for**:
- Black beans (remove all)
- Insect damage (holes)
- Broken beans
- Foreign matter
- Color uniformity

**Grading**:
- Specialty: 0-5 defects per 300g
- Premium: 6-12 defects
- Commercial: 13-25 defects

### Roasted Beans

**Inspect for**:
- Quakers (light beans)
- Scorched beans (dark spots)
- Tipped beans
- Broken beans
- Shells (empty shells)

## Training Exercises

### Exercise 1: Defect Spike

**Protocol**:
1. Cup clean coffee (baseline)
2. Add 1 defect bean to sample
3. Cup again
4. Note difference
5. Identify defect type

**Progression**:
- Start with severe defects (easy)
- Progress to subtle defects
- Decrease defect concentration
- Build sensitivity

### Exercise 2: Defect Sorting

**Materials**:
- Mix of green beans with defects
- Sorting tray

**Protocol**:
1. Sort 300g sample
2. Remove all defects
3. Categorize defects
4. Count each type
5. Compare to standard

**Timing**:
- Professional: 300g in <10 minutes
- Beginner: Take needed time
- Accuracy over speed initially

### Exercise 3: Blind Defect Identification

**Setup**:
- 5 cups: 1 clean, 4 with different defects
- Taste all
- Identify defect types

**Difficulty**:
- Start with obvious defects
- Increase subtlety
- Multiple defects in one cup (advanced)

## SCA Defect Standards

### Specialty Grade

**Requirements**:
- 0 primary defects (quakers allowed)
- Maximum 5 secondary defects (per 300g)
- No cup faults

**Defect Equivalents**:
- 1 black bean = 1 full defect
- 5 insect damaged = 1 full defect
- Specific conversion table

## Practical Applications

### For Cuppers

**Quality Control**:
- Detect defects before purchasing
- Grade coffee accurately
- Price appropriately
- Reject bad lots

### For Roasters

**Pre-Roast Sorting**:
- Remove visible defects
- Improve cup quality
- Consistency
- Brand protection

**Post-Roast Inspection**:
- Remove quakers
- Identify roast defects
- Quality verification

### For Buyers

**Purchasing**:
- Recognize defects in cupping
- Negotiate based on quality
- Verify grade claims
- Protect business

### For Baristas

**Cafe QC**:
- Spot-check beans
- Identify problems early
- Communicate with roaster
- Maintain standards

## Conclusion

Defect recognition:
- Learnable skill
- Critical for quality
- Professional necessity
- Protects consumers
- Ensures standards

Training helps:
- Avoid bad coffee
- Assess quality accurately
- Make informed decisions
- Professional competence
