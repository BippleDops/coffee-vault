# Palate Training Exercises for Coffee Tasting

## Overview

Professional coffee tasting ability is a learnable skill developed through systematic practice. These exercises build sensory memory, discrimination ability, and tasting confidence.

## Foundation Skills

### 1. Basic Taste Recognition

**The 5 Basic Tastes**:

**Sweet**:
- Reference: Sugar water (5-10% solution)
- In coffee: Caramel, honey notes
- Exercise: Identify sweetness levels

**Sour/Acidic**:
- Reference: Lemon juice (diluted)
- In coffee: Brightness, acidity
- Exercise: Acid intensity levels

**Bitter**:
- Reference: Tonic water, dark chocolate
- In coffee: Dark roasts, over-extraction
- Exercise: Bitterness thresholds

**Salty**:
- Reference: Salt water
- In coffee: Under-extraction indicator
- Exercise: Detect saltiness

**Umami**:
- Reference: Soy sauce (diluted)
- In coffee: Rare, some processing methods
- Exercise: Savory recognition

### 2. Aroma Identification

**Exercise 1: Single Aroma Recognition**

**Materials Needed**:
- 10-15 reference aromas
- Small jars with lids
- Labels (hidden initially)

**Protocol**:
1. Smell each daily
2. Build memory association
3. Test blindly weekly
4. Expand repertoire gradually

**Starting Kit**:
- Cinnamon
- Vanilla
- Lemon peel
- Dark chocolate
- Almond
- Caramel candy
- Coffee (different roasts)

**Exercise 2: Aroma Matching**

**Setup**:
- 5 coffee samples
- 10 aroma references
- Match coffees to aromas

**Difficulty Progression**:
- Week 1: Obvious matches
- Week 4: Subtle notes
- Week 8: Complex combinations

## Cupping Practice

### Weekly Cupping Routine

**Schedule**: Same day/time weekly

**Setup**:
1. 4-6 different coffees
2. SCA cupping protocol
3. Score each coffee
4. Compare notes if group
5. Track scores over time

**Coffees to Include**:
- 1 familiar reference
- 2-3 new coffees
- 1 challenging (defect or unusual)
- Variety of origins and processes

### Triangle Test

**Professional Calibration**

**Setup**:
- 3 cups: 2 identical, 1 different
- Identify the different one
- Tests discrimination

**Protocol**:
1. Prepare 3 cups (2A, 1B)
2. Randomize positions
3. Taste all three
4. Identify different one
5. Verify answer

**Benefits**:
- Builds confidence
- Tests sensitivity
- Professional standard
- Objective measurement

**Progression**:
- Start with very different samples
- Gradually increase similarity
- Track success rate
- 70%+ = good discrimination

## Intensity Scaling

### Exercise: Acid Intensity

**Materials**:
- Same coffee at different concentrations
- Or same origin, different roast levels

**Protocol**:
1. Taste in order (light to strong)
2. Rate intensity (1-10 scale)
3. Build intensity reference
4. Apply to new coffees

**Apply to All Attributes**:
- Acidity intensity
- Sweetness intensity
- Bitterness intensity
- Body weight
- Aroma intensity

## Flavor Mapping

### Exercise: Flavor Wheel Practice

**Weekly Challenge**:
1. Select 1 coffee
2. Taste systematically
3. Identify 5-10 specific descriptors
4. Place on flavor wheel
5. Verify with others if possible

**Progressive Difficulty**:
- Week 1: General (fruity, nutty)
- Week 4: Specific (blueberry, almond)
- Week 8: Very specific (meyer lemon, raw almond)

### Memory Building

**Taste-Aroma Association**:
1. Taste fresh blueberry
2. Smell blueberry
3. Taste coffee with blueberry notes
4. Connect experiences
5. Build neural pathway

**Repeat for Each Descriptor**:
- Systematic coverage
- Multiple instances
- Varied contexts
- Strong memory formation

## Defect Recognition

### Training for Defects

**Common Defects**:

**Sour/Fermented**:
- Reference: Over-fermented coffee sample
- Or vinegar note
- Exercise: Spike clean coffee with defect

**Phenolic/Medicinal**:
- Reference: Rio/Rioy sample
- Or band-aid smell
- Exercise: Detection threshold

**Earthy/Musty** (Negative):
- Reference: Potato defect coffee
- Exercise: Identify in blind tasting

### Defect Spiking

**Controlled Exposure**:
1. Start with clean coffee
2. Add small amount of defect
3. Taste and identify
4. Increase dilution
5. Find detection threshold

**Safety**:
- Use commercial defect standards
- Or known defect samples
- Professional kits available
- Le Nez du Café defect kit

## Body and Texture

### Mouthfeel Exercises

**Exercise: Body Comparison**

**Materials**:
- Same coffee, different brew strengths
- Or different origins (light to full body)

**Protocol**:
1. Prepare multiple samples
2. Rate body (1-5 scale)
3. Compare to references
4. Build tactile memory

**Reference Scale**:
- 1: Tea-like, very light
- 2: Light body
- 3: Medium body
- 4: Medium-full, creamy
- 5: Full, syrupy

### Texture Attributes

**Practice Identifying**:
- Silky vs creamy
- Smooth vs astringent
- Round vs sharp
- Heavy vs light

## Comparative Tasting

### Side-by-Side Comparison

**Exercise Format**:

**Same Origin, Different Processing**:
- Ethiopian washed vs natural
- Identify processing impact
- Build processing literacy

**Same Processing, Different Origins**:
- Washed Colombian vs Kenyan
- Highlight terroir differences
- Build origin knowledge

**Same Coffee, Different Roast Levels**:
- Light vs medium vs dark
- Understand roast impact
- Develop roasting knowledge

### Systematic Comparison Protocol

**Steps**:
1. Cup both coffees
2. Note each independently
