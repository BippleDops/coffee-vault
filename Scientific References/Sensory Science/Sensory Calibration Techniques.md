# Sensory Calibration Techniques

## Overview

Sensory calibration ensures consistent, objective coffee evaluation across tasters and time. These techniques align perceptions, standardize scoring, and maintain quality assessment reliability.

## Why Calibration Matters

**Individual Variation**:
- Genetic differences in taste/smell
- Experience variations
- Personal biases
- Terminology differences

**Solution**: Calibration creates shared reference points

## Calibration Methods

### Reference Coffees

**Standard Samples**:
- Known quality coffees
- Documented characteristics
- Stable over time
- Regularly used

**Protocol**:
1. Establish reference set (5-10 coffees)
2. Cup regularly (monthly minimum)
3. Score consistently
4. Maintain scoring accuracy

**Example Reference Set**:
- Excellent (90+ pts)
- Very Good (85-89 pts)
- Good (80-84 pts)
- Moderate (75-79 pts)
- Below Specialty (<75 pts)

### Group Calibration Sessions

**Process**:
1. Cup same coffees independently
2. Score without discussion
3. Compare scores
4. Discuss differences
5. Align understanding
6. Re-cup if needed

**Frequency**:
- Weekly (professionals)
- Monthly (serious amateurs)
- Before major evaluations
- When adding new cuppers

### Triangulation Testing

**Standard Calibration**:
- Discrimination ability testing
- Objective performance measure
- Industry standard
- Regular practice

**Success Criteria**:
- 70%+ correct = good discrimination
- 80%+ = professional level
- Regular testing maintains skill

## Intensity Scaling

### Attribute Intensity References

**Create Standards for Each Attribute**:

**Acidity** (Example):
- Level 1: Barely detectable
- Level 5: Moderate, pleasant
- Level 10: Intense, dominating

**Physical References**:
- Use actual acid solutions
- Citric acid (diluted)
- Multiple concentrations
- Taste regularly

**Coffee References**:
- Low-acid Brazilian (Level 3)
- Medium Colombian (Level 6)
- High-acid Kenyan (Level 9)

### Consistency Training

**Exercise**:
1. Cup same coffee multiple times
2. Score each time
3. Compare scores
4. Target: ±0.5 point variation
5. Improve consistency

## Vocabulary Standardization

### Lexicon Use

**World Coffee Research Lexicon**:
- 110 flavor attributes
- Defined standards
- Reference materials available
- Industry standard

**Application**:
- Use defined terms
- Avoid personal descriptors
- Common language
- Professional communication

### Descriptor Alignment

**Group Exercise**:
1. Taste same coffee
2. Write descriptors independently
3. Compare
4. Discuss perception differences
5. Agree on standard terms

## Calibration Schedule

### Professional (Q Graders)

**Requirements**:
- Recalibrate every 36 months (minimum)
- Triangulation tests
- Sensory acuity verification
- Industry standard maintenance

### Professional Cuppers

**Best Practices**:
- Monthly reference cupping
- Quarterly triangle testing
- Annual complete recalibration
- Continuous practice

### Serious Amateurs

**Recommendations**:
- Quarterly reference cupping
- Semi-annual group calibration
- Regular practice
- Online courses

## Biological Considerations

### Genetic Variations

**Supertasters**:
- More taste buds
- Intense perception
- Can be overwhelming
- Bitter very sensitive

**Non-tasters**:
- Fewer taste buds
- Less sensitivity
- Specific compounds

**Managing**:
- Know your type
- Adjust intensity scales personally
- Consistent self-reference
- Communicate clearly

### Specific Anosmias

**Compound Blindness**:
- Genetic inability to smell certain compounds
- Common (10-15% population for some compounds)
- Not trainable
- Acknowledge limitations

**Examples**:
- Androstenone blindness
- Asparagus anosmia
- Others

**Solution**:
- Use panel approach (multiple tasters)
- Acknowledge in scoring
- Rely on others for blind-spot compounds

## Environmental Factors

### Palate Neutrality

**Before Cupping**:
- No strong flavors (2 hours minimum)
- Brush teeth
- Avoid mouthwash (interferes)
- Hydrate well
- No smoking

**During Cupping**:
- Rinse between samples
- Spit, don't swallow (caffeine accumulation)
- Fresh water
- Palate cleansers (water only)

### Time of Day

**Optimal**:
- Mid-morning (10-11am) often best
- Palate fresh
- Not hungry (affects perception)
- Not too full (decreases sensitivity)

**Avoid**:
- Immediately after meals
- Late afternoon (fatigue)
- When ill
- When stressed

## Scoring Calibration

### Intensity vs Quality

**Distinguish**:
- Intensity: How strong (0-10)
- Quality: How good (descriptive or scored)

**Example - Acidity**:
- Intensity: 8/10 (very acidic)
- Quality: "bright, citric, pleasant" (positive)
- Or: "sharp, aggressive, unpleasant" (negative)

### Consistent Scoring

**Practice**:
1. Cup same coffee multiple days
2. Score independently each time
3. Compare scores
4. Aim for ±0.5 consistency
5. Investigate larger variations

## Professional Standards

## Practical Exercises

### Weekly Group Cupping

1. 4-6 coffees
2. Cup independently
3. Score separately
4. Compare results
5. Discuss differences
6. Calibrate understanding

1. Someone else prepares known reference coffees
2. Cup blindly
3. Score and describe
4. Reveal identities
5. Check against historical scores
6. Adjust if drifting
