# ☕ Body

**Category**: Sensory Science → Mouthfeel  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Related**: [[Perceived Acidity]], [[Bitterness]], [[Flavor Development]], [[Roasting Science]]

## 📋 Overview

**Body** (or mouthfeel) describes the physical weight, texture, and substance of coffee on the palate. It's distinct from flavor, representing how coffee *feels* rather than how it *tastes*. Body is one of the most important quality indicators and contributes significantly to coffee appreciation.

**Key Insight**: Body comes from dissolved compounds and extraction - it's both a physical phenomenon and a sensory experience that can be evaluated and controlled.

## 🔬 Physical Components

**Dissolved Solids** (TDS):
- Coffee solubles in solution
- 1.15-1.45% typical concentration
- Higher TDS = more body
- Lower TDS = lighter body
- Measurable component

**Lipids & Oils**:
- Emulsified coffee oils
- Contribute: Creaminess, richness
- Enhanced by roasting
- Filter paper removes some
- Espresso has more

**Proteins & Polysaccharides**:
- Carbohydrate complexes
- Contribute: Thickness, viscosity
- Developed in roasting
- Caramelization products
- Body-building compounds

**Tannins & Polyphenols**:
- Phenolic compounds
- Contribute: Astringency (negative)
- Balance important
- Extraction dependent
- Can reduce body perception

## 📊 Body Types

**Light Body**:
- **Feeling**: Thin, watery, tea-like
- **TDS**: Low (<1.3%)
- **Association**: Light roasts, under-extraction
- **Character**: Delicate, clean, bright
- **Application**: Specialty light roasts, tea-like profiles

**Medium Body**:
- **Feeling**: Pleasant weight, balanced
- **TDS**: Moderate (1.3-1.4%)
- **Association**: Balanced roasts/brewing
- **Character**: Approachable, versatile
- **Application**: Most specialty coffee

**Full Body**:
- **Feeling**: Heavy, substantial, rich
- **TDS**: High (>1.4%)
- **Association**: Dark roasts, over-extraction, immersion
- **Character**: Rich, bold, mouth-filling
- **Application**: Espresso, dark roasts, milk drinks

## 🔥 Roasting Impact

**Light Roast**:
- **Body**: Lighter, cleaner
- **Cause**: Less caramelization, lipids undeveloped
- **Association**: Bright, acidic coffees
- **Character**: Delicate, tea-like

**Medium Roast**:
- **Body**: Moderate, balanced
- **Cause**: Developing caramelization, body-building
- **Association**: Nutty, chocolate coffees
- **Character**: Pleasant, approachable

**Dark Roast**:
- **Body**: Full, heavy
- **Cause**: Extensive caramelization, oil migration
- **Association**: Bold, smoky coffees
- **Character**: Rich, mouth-filling

## 💧 Extraction Impact

**Under-Extraction**:
- **Body**: Thin, watery
- **Cause**: Insufficient solids dissolved
- **Character**: Light, underdeveloped
- **Fix**: Extract more compounds

**Optimal Extraction**:
- **Body**: Balanced, appropriate
- **Cause**: Appropriate solids dissolved
- **Character**: Pleasant, substantial
- **Balance**: Matches coffee potential

**Over-Extraction**:
- **Body**: Heavy but astringent
- **Cause**: Too many compounds, including harsh
- **Character**: Thick but unpleasant
- **Fix**: Reduce extraction

## 🎯 Brewing Method Effects

**Pour Over (V60, Chemex)**:
- **Body**: Lighter, cleaner
- **Cause**: Paper filters remove oils
- **Character**: Bright, clean, tea-like
- **Typical**: 1.2-1.4% TDS

**Immersion (French Press, AeroPress)**:
- **Body**: Full, rich
- **Cause**: Metal filters keep oils
- **Character**: Heavy, mouth-filling
- **Typical**: 1.4-1.6% TDS

**Espresso**:
- **Body**: Very full, syrupy
- **Cause**: High pressure, concentrated
- **Character**: Heavy, intense
- **Typical**: 8-12% TDS (concentrated)

**Cold Brew**:
- **Body**: Moderate-full
- **Cause**: Long steep, low temp
- **Character**: Smooth, substantial
- **Typical**: 1.3-1.5% TDS

## 🌍 Origin Differences

**Higher Body Potential**:
- **Robusta**: Higher solids, fuller body
- **Lower altitude**: More body-building compounds
- **Natural process**: Fruit mucilage retention
- **Sumatra**: Inherent full body

**Lower Body Potential**:
- **High-altitude Arabica**: Lighter, cleaner
- **Washed process**: Cleaner, less body
- **Ethiopian**: Typically lighter body
- **Some varieties**: Inherent light body

## 📊 Sensory Evaluation

**SCA Body Score**:
- 10 - Outstanding, exceptional fullness
- 9-8 - Distinctly heavy, substantial
- 7 - Good body presence
- 6 - Acceptable but unremarkable
- 5 - Barely acceptable
- 4< - Defective, thin, watery

**Tasting Descriptors**:
- Positive: "Full", "Rich", "Heavy", "Creamy", "Syrupy"
- Negative: "Thin", "Watery", "Astringent", "Flat"
- Neutral: "Light", "Delicate", "Tea-like"

## 🎯 Balance Considerations

**Body + Acidity**:
- Light body + high acidity = Bright, tea-like
- Medium body + balanced acidity = Approachable
- Full body + low acidity = Heavy, bold
- Balance: Match to preference

**Body + Bitterness**:
- Full body + high bitterness = Potentially heavy
- Light body + balanced bitterness = Pleasant
- Balance: Appropriate for roast level

**Body + Sweetness**:
- Full body + sweetness = Rich, decadent
- Light body + brightness = Delicate, elegant
- Balance: Complements flavor profile
