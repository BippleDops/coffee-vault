# Professional Coffee Tasting Protocols

## Overview

Professional tasting protocols standardize coffee evaluation, enabling objective quality assessment, fair competition judging, and consistent communication across the industry.

## SCA Cupping Protocol (Industry Standard)

### Setup Requirements

**Equipment Per Coffee**:
- 5 cups (for consistency verification)
- 8.25g coffee per cup
- 150ml hot water (200°F / 93°C)
- Cupping spoon (deep, rounded)
- Spittoon
- Rinse water (hot)

**Coffee Preparation**:
- Grind immediately before cupping
- Medium-coarse grind
- 8-10 on commercial grinder scale
- Fresh grind critical

**Water**:
- Clean, odor-free
- TDS: 125-175 ppm
- Temperature: exactly 200°F (93°C)
- Pour within 15 minutes of grinding

### Cupping Steps

**1. Fragrance (Dry)**:
- Smell grounds
- Evaluate before water
- Note intensity and quality
- Score 6.0-10.0

**2. Pour**:
- Saturate all grounds
- Start timer
- Let steep 3-5 minutes
- Crust forms

**3. Break**:
- At 3-4 minutes
- Stir 3 times (break crust)
- Smell released aromatics
- "Breaking" moment
- Score Aroma 6.0-10.0

**4. Skim**:
- Remove foam/floating grounds
- Clean surface
- Prepare for tasting

**5. Taste** (After 8-10 minutes, once cooled):
- Slurp loudly (aerate)
- Coat entire palate
- Note flavor attributes
- Spit, don't swallow

**6. Score**:
- Flavor: 6.0-10.0
- Aftertaste: 6.0-10.0
- Acidity: 6.0-10.0
- Body: 6.0-10.0
- Balance: 6.0-10.0

**7. Additional Scores**:
- Clean Cup: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (2 pts per cup max)
- Sweetness: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (2 pts per cup max)
- Uniformity: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (2 pts per cup max)
- Overall: 6.0-10.0

**8. Defects**:
- Taint (-2 per cup)
- Fault (-4 per cup)
- Record intensity

**9. Final Score**: Sum all components (0-100 scale)

### Scoring Standards

**Specialty Grade**: ≥80 points
**Very Good**: 85-89.99
**Excellent**: 90-94.99
**Outstanding**: 95+

## Cup of Excellence Protocol

### Differences from SCA

**More Rigorous**:
- Multiple cupping rounds
- Multiple cuppers
- Blind evaluation
- Calibration sessions
- Higher standards

**Process**:
1. Pre-selection (national cuppers)
2. National jury
3. International jury
4. Re-cupping finalists
5. Auction for highest scored

## Q Grader Cupping

### Calibration Standards

**Requirements**:
- Cup alongside certified Q instructors
- Score within ±1 point on 4/5 samples
- Demonstrate consistency
- Identify defects accurately

**Exercises**:
- Cupping to score
- Triangulation
- Olfactory tests
- Roast level identification
- Green coffee grading

## Commercial Cupping

### Buying and Contracting

**Pre-Shipment Sample**:
- Cup before committing
- Verify quality
- Grade confirmation
- Defect check

**Arrival Sample**:
- Cup upon arrival
- Verify consistency
- Check for damage
- Approve shipment

**Protocol**:
- Modified SCA often
- Focus on defects
- Commercial tolerances
- Pass/fail decisions

## Comparative Cupping

### Side-by-Side Evaluation

**Applications**:
- Roast profile comparison
- Before/after changes
- Competition judging
- R&D

**Protocol**:
1. Identical prep for both samples
2. Cup simultaneously
3. Direct comparison
4. Note differences specifically
5. Preference indication

## Calibration Exercises

### Weekly Practice

**Reference Cupping**:
- Same coffee weekly
- Track score consistency
- Monitor drift
- Maintain standards

### Monthly Triangle

**Discrimination Test**:
- Formal triangle setup
- Track success rate
- Maintain >70%
- Identify training needs

### Quarterly Comprehensive

**Full Calibration**:
- Reference set cupping
- Group calibration
- Triangulation battery
- Defect recognition
- Intensity scaling verification

## Environmental Control

### Cupping Room Standards

**Temperature**: 20-25°C (68-77°F)
**Humidity**: 40-60% RH
**Odors**: None (no perfume, smoke, food)
**Lighting**: Bright, neutral (natural light ideal)
**Noise**: Quiet environment

**Violations Affect**:
- Temperature: Affects coffee cooling, extraction
- Odors: Contaminate perception
- Lighting: Visual assessment affected

## Palate Preparation

### Pre-Cupping

**Avoid** (2+ hours before):
- Strong flavors
- Alcohol
- Smoking
- Spicy food
- Coffee (believe it or not)

**Do**:
- Drink water
- Brush teeth (no flavored toothpaste)
- Neutral state
- Rested

### During Cupping

**Rinse**:
- Between each coffee
- Hot water
- Cleanse palate
- Spit rinse water

**Hydration**:
- Water available
- Prevent dehydration
- Maintain sensitivity

## Data Management

### Cupping Forms

**Standard Forms**:
- SCA cupping form
- COE form
- Custom forms
- Digital apps

**Information Captured**:
- All attribute scores
- Descriptors
- Defects
- Final score
- Comments

### Digital Tools

**Applications**:
- Cropster Cup
- Typica
- Google Forms (custom)
- Excel spreadsheets

**Benefits**:
- Data aggregation
- Historical comparison
- Statistical analysis
- Calibration tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Consistency Checks

**Blind Recupping**:
- Cup same coffee multiple times (blind)
- Scores should be within ±1 point
- Large variation = calibration needed

**Inter-Cupper Reliability**:
- Multiple cuppers, same coffees
- Compare scores
- Should be within ±2 points
- Outliers investigated

## Practical Applications

### For Roasters

**QC Cupping**:
- Every batch ideally
- Minimum: Daily
- Verify roast quality
- Catch defects

**Profile Development**:
- Comparative cupping
- Iteration testing
- Target achievement

### For Buyers

**Purchasing**:
- Pre-purchase evaluation
- Contract verification
- Defect detection
- Price negotiation basis

### For Competitors

**Competition Prep**:
- Know protocols
- Practice extensively
- Calibrate to judges
- Understand scoring

### For Educators

**Teaching**:
- Use standard protocols
- Train to industry standards
- Calibration emphasis
- Professional preparation
