# ⏱️ Temporal Dominance of Sensations

**Category**: Sensory Science  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Track flavor evolution over time

---

## 📋 Overview

Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) tracks which flavors dominate at each moment during tasting - capturing coffee's dynamic evolution as it cools, revealing how perceived flavors change over time in ways static cupping misses.

**What is TDS**:
- **Time-Based**: Track dominant flavor at each time point
- **Dynamic**: Captures flavor evolution as coffee cools
- **Research**: Advanced sensory methodology
- **Insight**: Reveals temporal flavor patterns

**Why It Matters**:
- Coffee flavors change dramatically as it cools
- Different compounds perceived at different temps
- Understanding evolution aids quality assessment

## 🔬 Method

**Process**:
1. Taste coffee hot (160-180°F)
2. Note dominant flavor
3. Re-taste every 30-60 seconds as cools
4. Track which flavor dominates at each temp
5. Create temporal profile

**Results**: Shows flavor evolution hot → warm → cool

## ☕ Typical Patterns

**Hot** (160-180°F): Bitterness, roast notes dominant  
**Warm** (140-160°F): Sweetness emerges, complexity peaks  
**Cool** (120-140°F): Acidity clarifies, fruit notes emerge  
**Room Temp** (70-90°F): Subtle flavors, defects reveal

## 📝 Summary

Temporal Dominance of Sensations tracks flavor evolution as coffee cools - revealing dynamic changes from hot (bitterness) to warm (sweetness peak) to cool (acidity/fruit clarity), capturing coffee's temporal complexity missed by single-temperature cupping.
