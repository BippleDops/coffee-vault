# 🦠 Coffee Berry Disease (CBD)

**Category**: Coffee Agronomy  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand CBD and integrated management strategies

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is devastating fungal disease affecting coffee cherries - causing yield losses up to 80% in susceptible varieties, particularly problematic in East Africa. Understanding CBD and integrated pest management enables disease control while minimizing fungicide dependence through resistant varieties, cultural practices, and biological controls.

**What is Coffee Berry Disease**:
- **Pathogen**: Colletotrichum kahawae (fungus)
- **Target**: Coffee cherries (not leaves like rust)
- **Symptoms**: Brown lesions on cherries, shriveling, premature drop
- **Impact**: 30-80% yield loss in susceptible varieties
- **Geographic**: Primarily Africa (especially Kenya, Ethiopia, East Africa)
- **Weather**: Thrives in cool, wet conditions (high altitude, rainy)

**Why CBD Matters**:
- **Devastating**: Can destroy 80% of crop
- **East Africa**: Major threat to premium origins (Kenya especially)
- **Resistant Varieties**: Drove development of SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru 11, Batian
- **Economic**: Forces variety replacement or heavy fungicide use
- **Quality Impact**: Affects cherry quality, farmer livelihoods

## 🔬 Disease Biology

**Infection**:
- **Conditions**: Cool temperatures (15-20°C), high humidity, rainfall
- **Timing**: Affects expanding/young cherries (3-16 weeks after flowering)
- **Spread**: Rain splash, wind, insects
- **Severity**: Worst at high altitude (cool, wet conditions)

**Symptoms**:
- **Early**: Small brown spots on green cherries
- **Advanced**: Spots expand, cherry shrivels, blackens
- **Severe**: Premature cherry drop, total crop loss

## 🛡️ Integrated Management

**Resistant Varieties** (Most Effective):
- **Ruiru 11**: First CBD-resistant Kenyan variety
- **Batian**: Modern resistant variety, better quality
- **Catimor**: Resistant but lower quality
- **Long-Term**: Variety replacement most sustainable

**Cultural Practices**:
- **Pruning**: Improve air circulation (reduces humidity)
- **Spacing**: Adequate plant spacing (airflow)
- **Shade Management**: Balance shade benefits vs. humidity
- **Sanitation**: Remove infected cherries, reduce inoculum
- **Timing**: Avoid planting susceptible varieties in high-risk zones

**Chemical Control** (When Necessary):
- **Fungicides**: Copper-based, systemic fungicides
- **Timing**: Preventive applications (before infection)
- **Cost**: Expensive, environmental concerns
- **Resistance**: Pathogen can develop resistance
- **Minimization**: Use only when necessary, integrate with other strategies

**Biological Control** (Emerging):
- **Beneficial Microbes**: Antagonistic fungi/bacteria
- **Research**: Ongoing, promising but not yet standard

## 📝 Summary

Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is devastating fungal disease causing 30-80% yield loss through cherry infection - managed through resistant varieties (Batian, Ruiru 11 most effective), cultural practices (pruning, spacing, airflow), and minimal fungicides when necessary. Resistant variety adoption is most sustainable long-term solution, enabling high-altitude East African coffee without heavy fungicide dependence.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **CBD**: Fungal disease, cherries, 30-80% loss potential
- **East Africa**: Primary threat (Kenya, Ethiopia especially)
- **Resistant Varieties**: Most effective management (Batian, Ruiru 11)
- **Cultural**: Pruning, spacing, airflow reduce disease pressure
- **Fungicides**: Minimize, use only when necessary
