# 🌱 Coffee Plant Pruning and Management Techniques

**Category**: Coffee Agronomy  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand pruning methods for productivity and longevity

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee plant pruning is essential farm management practice that rejuvenates aging trees, maintains productivity, controls height for easier harvesting, and extends productive lifespan. Proper pruning techniques can double or triple a coffee farm's economic life while maintaining quality and yield.

**Why Pruning Matters**:
- **Productivity**: Maintains yield as trees age
- **Height Control**: Keeps trees harvestable (trees can grow 6-10 meters if unpruned)
- **Rejuvenation**: Stimulates new growth, fresh productive wood
- **Quality**: Young wood produces better quality cherries
- **Longevity**: Extends farm productive life from 20 years to 40-60+ years
- **Economics**: Cheaper than replanting, maintains production

**Pruning Types**:
1. **Recepa** (Stumping): Cut to 30-40cm, complete rejuvenation
2. **Zoca** (Capping): Cut main stem, retain lateral branches
3. **Selective Pruning**: Remove old/unproductive branches only
4. **Agobiado** (Bending): Bend stems to stimulate lateral growth

## 🔧 Pruning Methods

### 1. Recepa (Stumping / Severe Pruning)

**Method**:
- Cut main stem to 30-40cm (12-16 inches) above ground
- **Complete Reset**: Entire above-ground portion removed
- New shoots grow from stump

**Timing**:
- After harvest season (trees recover during wet season)
- Every 5-8 years (rotation through farm)

**Recovery**:
- **Year 1**: No production (recovery year)
- **Year 2**: 30-50% normal yield
- **Year 3+**: 100% yield or higher

**Benefits**:
- Complete rejuvenation
- New vigorous growth
- Reset tree height
- Maximum productivity restoration

**Challenge**:
- One year lost production
- Requires planning (rotate sections)

### 2. Zoca (Capping)

**Method**:
- Cut main stem at 1.5-2 meters height
- Retain some lateral branches
- Less severe than recepa

**Recovery**:
- **Same year**: 20-30% production from retained branches
- **Year 2**: 70-80% yield
- **Year 3**: 100% yield

**Benefits**:
- Faster recovery
- Some production maintained
- Height controlled

### 3. Selective Pruning

**Method**:
- Remove old, unproductive branches only
- Retain young, vigorous wood
- Annual maintenance

**Benefits**:
- Continuous production
- Gradual renewal
- Minimal disruption

## 📝 Summary

Coffee pruning is essential farm management that maintains productivity, controls height, rejuvenates aging trees, and extends economic lifespan. Recepa and zoca are primary techniques, with recepa providing complete rejuvenation at cost of one recovery year.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Recepa**: Severe cut, complete rejuvenation, 1 year recovery
- **Zoca**: Moderate cut, faster recovery, height control
- **Selective**: Annual maintenance, continuous production
- **Economics**: Cheaper than replanting, maintains farm productivity
- **Timing**: After harvest, during recovery season
