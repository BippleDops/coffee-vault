## 📋 Overview

Companion planting integrates beneficial species with coffee - providing nitrogen fixation, pest control, biodiversity, and ecosystem services while improving coffee quality through shade and microclimate moderation.

**Benefits**:
- **Nitrogen Fixation**: Legume trees provide nitrogen
- **Pest Control**: Biodiversity reduces pest pressure
- **Shade**: Moderates temperature, slows maturation
- **Soil Health**: Organic matter, structure improvement
- **Ecosystem Services**: Beyond coffee production
