### Common Robusta Varietals

- Indonesian Robusta
- Indian Robusta
- Ugandan Robusta
- Vietnam Robusta (major export)

## Chemistry Comparison

### Caffeine Content

- **Arabica**: 0.9-1.7% by weight
- **Robusta**: 2.0-4.0% by weight
- **Impact**: Robusta is nearly twice as caffeinated

### Sugar Content

- **Arabica**: ~6-9% sucrose
- **Robusta**: ~3-7% sucrose
- **Impact**: Arabica is naturally sweeter

### Chlorogenic Acids (CGA)

- **Arabica**: Lower CGA content
- **Robusta**: Higher CGA content
- **Impact**: Robusta has more antioxidants but also more bitterness

### Lipids (Oils)

- **Arabica**: ~15-17% lipids
- **Robusta**: ~10-12% lipids
- **Impact**: Arabica contributes to body and mouthfeel

## Market and Pricing

### Arabica

- **Price**: Generally 2-4x higher than Robusta
- **Market**: Specialty coffee market, single-origin coffees
- **Premium Pricing**: Based on quality, origin, processing

### Robusta

- **Price**: Lower commodity pricing
- **Market**: Instant coffee, espresso blends, commercial products
- **Volume**: Vietnam is largest producer

## Processing Differences

### Arabica

- Typically wet-washed
- More delicate processing required
- Full cherry processing common
- Honey and natural processing popular

### Robusta

- Often dry-processed
- Hardier, more forgiving
- Higher volume processing
- Less focus on quality processing

## Brewing Considerations

### Arabica

**Best Methods**:
- Pour-over (Chemex, V60)
- Espresso (single-origin)
- Filter coffee
- Aeropress

**Parameters**:
- Lower temperature acceptable (90-94°C)
- Grind size varies by method
- Benefits from careful extraction

### Robusta

**Best Methods**:
- Espresso blends (mixed with Arabica)
- Traditional Italian moka pot
- Instant coffee
- Vietnamese phin coffee

**Parameters**:
- Often blended with Arabica
- Can handle higher temperature
- Less extraction precision needed

## Quality Grading

### Arabica Grading

- **Highest**: Specialty grade (80+ points on SCA scale)
- **High**: Premium (single-origin)
- **Medium**: Commercial grade
- **Lower**: Robusta blends, commodity coffee

### Robusta Grading

- Quality grades exist but less standardized
- Screen size important
- Primarily evaluated by defect count

## Practical Applications

### For Consumers

- **Choose Arabica** for: Daily specialty coffee, exploring origins, appreciating subtlety
- **Choose Robusta** for: Strong caffeine needs, traditional espresso blends, cost-conscious brewing

### For Home Roasters

- **Arabica**: Focus on development, accentuate origin characteristics
- **Robusta**: More forgiving, but quality ceiling is lower

### For Baristas

- **Know your blend**: Understand Robusta percentage
- **Adjust extraction**: Robusta needs different parameters
- **Educate customers**: Explain differences appropriately

## Myths and Misconceptions

### Myth: "Robusta is always bad"

**Reality**: High-quality Robusta exists but is rare. Most Robusta is commodity-grade.

### Myth: "Arabica always better"

**Reality**: Poorly processed Arabica can be worse than quality Robusta. Context matters.

### Myth: "Robusta = higher caffeine always"

**Reality**: True on average, but brewing method and roast level also affect caffeine extraction.

## Future Trends

### Arabica

- Climate-resistant cultivars in development
- Shifting growing regions
- Focus on quality over quantity

### Robusta

- Specialty Robusta emerging
- Sustainability improvements
- Better processing techniques

## Conclusion

Both species have their place:

- **Arabica**: Specialty coffee, complexity, terroir expression
- **Robusta**: Espresso blends, strength, cost-effectiveness

Understanding both enhances coffee appreciation and allows informed purchasing decisions.
