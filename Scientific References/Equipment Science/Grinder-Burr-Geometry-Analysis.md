# Grinder Burr Geometry Analysis: Flat vs. Conical Design and Performance

## Overview

Burr geometry—flat vs. conical design, burr size, tooth pattern, cutting angle—fundamentally affects particle size distribution, grinding efficiency, heat generation, and flavor expression. Flat burrs (parallel grinding disks) produce unimodal particle distributions with fewer fines, while conical burrs (nested cone design) create bimodal distributions with more fines and boulders but lower heat generation and quieter operation.

## Flat Burr Characteristics

**Design**: Two parallel disks with radial cutting teeth  
**Particle distribution**: Unimodal (narrow peak, fewer fines)  
**Heat generation**: Higher (more surface contact, higher RPM)  
**Flavor**: Clarity, brightness, defined flavor separation  
**Applications**: Espresso (modern specialty), pour-over (precision)  
**Examples**: Mahlkönig EK43, Lagom P64, Weber EG-1

## Conical Burr Characteristics

**Design**: Nested cones with helical cutting teeth  
**Particle distribution**: Bimodal (fines + boulders)  
**Heat generation**: Lower (less friction, gravity-assisted)  
**Flavor**: Body, complexity, layered flavors  
**Applications**: Espresso (traditional), French Press, cold brew  
**Examples**: Baratza Forte, Mazzer Super Jolly, Comandante (hand grinder)

## The Science

**Cutting mechanics**:
- **Flat**: Shearing action, radial particle movement
- **Conical**: Crushing and shearing, axial particle movement

**Particle size distribution**:
- **Flat**: σ = 200-300 μm (standard deviation)
- **Conical**: σ = 300-450 μm (wider distribution, more fines)

**Heat generation**:
- **Flat**: 5-15°C temperature rise (high-speed grinding)
- **Conical**: 2-5°C temperature rise (gravity-assisted, lower RPM)

## Practical Applications

**Choosing grinder type**:
- **Clarity priority**: Flat burrs (filter coffee, light roast espresso)
- **Body priority**: Conical burrs (traditional espresso, immersion)
- **Heat sensitivity**: Conical burrs (retain aromatics)
- **Workflow**: Flat burrs typically faster (higher RPM)

## Summary

- **Flat burrs produce unimodal distributions with fewer fines**: Parallel disk design creates narrow particle distribution (σ = 200-300 μm), enhancing clarity and flavor separation—preferred for modern espresso and pour-over
- **Conical burrs create bimodal distributions**: Nested cone design produces fines + boulders (σ = 300-450 μm), increasing body and complexity—traditional espresso and immersion brewing
- **Heat generation differs significantly**: Flat burrs generate 5-15°C rise (high RPM, surface contact); conical 2-5°C (gravity-assisted, lower RPM)—affects volatile retention
- **Flavor expression varies by geometry**: Flat emphasizes clarity, brightness, defined notes; conical emphasizes body, layered complexity, integrated flavors
