# Caffeine Chemistry and Extraction

## Overview

Caffeine is the most recognized compound in coffee, a natural stimulant affecting millions daily. Understanding its chemistry, extraction dynamics, and physiological effects enhances coffee knowledge.

## Caffeine Basics

### What is Caffeine?

**Chemical Structure**:
- Purine alkaloid
- 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine
- Related to theobromine (chocolate) and theophylline

**Natural Occurrence**:
- Coffee (Coffea species)
- Tea (Camellia sinensis)
- Cocoa (Theobroma cacao)
- Yerba mate
- Guarana
- Kola nut

**Function in Plant**:
- Natural pesticide (toxic to insects)
- Deters herbivores
- Competitive advantage for plant

### Physical Properties

**Solubility**:
- Highly water-soluble
- Dissolves well in hot water
- Extraction efficient during brewing

**Stability**:
- Stable at roasting temperatures
- Not degraded during typical roast profiles
- Survives long storage

**Appearance**:
- White crystalline powder (pure)
- Odorless
- Bitter taste

## Coffee vs Tea vs Other Sources

### Content Comparison

**Coffee** (8 oz brewed):
- Arabica: 95-165mg caffeine
- Robusta: 175-250mg caffeine
- Espresso (1 shot): 60-80mg

**Tea** (8 oz brewed):
- Black tea: 40-70mg
- Green tea: 30-50mg
- Oolong: 35-55mg

**Other Sources**:
- Dark chocolate (1 oz): 20-30mg
- Cola (12 oz): 30-40mg
- Energy drinks: 70-300mg+ (varies widely)

### Why Coffee Has More Caffeine

**Coffee Beans**:
- Dense, concentrated form
- Lots of caffeine per gram
- Efficient brewing extracts most

**Tea Leaves**:
- Lighter, less dense
- Caffeine content lower per gram
- Tea brewing less concentrated

## Varietal Differences

### Arabica vs Robusta

**Content Comparison**:
- Arabica: 0.9-1.7% caffeine by weight
- Robusta: 2.0-4.0% caffeine by weight
- Robusta has ~2x the caffeine

**Why the Difference**:
- Genetic variation between species
- Robusta evolved more caffeine for insect resistance
- Coffea canephora (Robusta) naturally higher
- Coffea arabica lower as species characteristic

**Practical Impact**:
- Robusta in blends increases caffeine
- Decaf made from Arabica easier
- Taste quality vs caffeine trade-off

### Within Variety Variation

**Factors Affecting Caffeine in Arabica**:
- Growing conditions (altitude affects development)
- Soil nutrition
- Plant genetics
- Processing methods (minimal impact)

**Range**:
- Typical Arabica: 1.0-1.5% caffeine
- High-end Arabica: Can reach 1.7%
- Lower quality Arabica: 0.9-1.2%

## Extraction During Brewing

### How Caffeine Extracts

**Solubility Properties**:
- Very soluble in water (33g per 100ml at 100°C)
- Extracts quickly
- Early in brewing process

**Extraction Timeline**:
- First 30 seconds: Rapid extraction
- By 1 minute: ~90% extracted
- Remaining time: Slow additional extraction
- Total: ~95-98% extracted in typical brew

### Factors Affecting Caffeine in Cup

**Roast Level** (minimal effect):
- Caffeine stable during roasting
- Percent by weight increases (bean loses water, caffeine stays)
- Volume/mass change creates perception of more caffeine in dark roast
- Actually: Brew strength more important

**Grind Size**:
- Finer grind = faster extraction
- More surface area = more efficient caffeine extraction
- But: Over-extraction of other compounds too

**Brew Method**:
- **Espresso**: Higher concentration, less volume
- **Drip/Pour-over**: More volume, lower concentration
- **French Press**: Full extraction
- **Cold Brew**: Extended contact time = more caffeine per bean

**Brew Ratio**:
- More coffee = more caffeine (obvious)
- Stronger ratios = higher caffeine
- Weak brews = lower caffeine

**Contact Time**:
- Longer steep = more caffeine extracted
- Espresso (25-30s) vs French Press (4min) vs Cold Brew (12-24hrs)
- Contact time largely determines extraction percentage

### Brew Method Comparison (caffeine per serving)

**Espresso** (1 shot / 1 oz):
- Caffeine: 60-80mg
- Very concentrated
- Small volume

**Drip Coffee** (8 oz):
- Caffeine: 95-165mg
- Standard brew
- Typical serving

**French Press** (8 oz):
- Caffeine: 100-180mg
- Longer steep
- Higher extraction

**Pour-Over** (8 oz):
- Caffeine: 95-165mg
- Similar to drip
- Controlled extraction

**Cold Brew** (8 oz):
- Caffeine: 120-200mg
- Long steep time
- Higher extraction per bean

**Cold Brew Concentrate** (diluted):
- Caffeine: 200-300mg+ per 8oz
- Concentrated preparation
- Very high caffeine

## Roasting Effects

### Caffeine Stability

**Heat Resistance**:
- Melting point: 235°C
- Decomposition: 290°C+
- Coffee roasting: 180-240°C typical
- Caffeine survives roasting intact

**What Changes**:
- Bean loses water (12-20% weight loss)
- Caffeine remains (dry matter basis)
- Percent by weight increases slightly
- Actual total caffeine per bean: Unchanged

**Common Misconception**:
- "Dark roast has more caffeine" = False
- Actual caffeine content per bean same
- Roast affects flavor, not caffeine level
- Brew strength determines caffeine in cup

### Roast Profile Impact

**Light Roast**:
- Higher moisture content
- Lower density
- More volume per gram
- Similar caffeine per gram

**Dark Roast**:
- Lower moisture content
- Slightly less density
- Less volume per gram
- Similar caffeine per gram

**Practical Difference**:
- None for caffeine content
- Dark roast: Lighter weight per scoop
- Volume-based measuring affects servings
- Weight-based: Same caffeine

## Physiological Effects

### How Caffeine Works

**Mechanism**:
- Blocks adenosine receptors in brain
- Adenosine causes drowsiness
- Blocking receptors = alertness

**Primary Effect**:
- Increased alertness
- Delayed fatigue
- Improved concentration
- Enhanced athletic performance

**Secondary Effects**:
- Increased heart rate
- Elevated blood pressure
- Diuretic effect (mild)
- Mood improvement

### Absorption and Metabolism

**Absorption**:
- Rapidly absorbed from stomach/intestines
- Peak blood level: 30-60 minutes
- Half-life: 4-6 hours typical
- Slower for some people

**Metabolism**:
- Liver breaks down caffeine
- Enzymes: CYP1A2 (primary)
- Genetics affect metabolism speed
- Smoking increases metabolism

**Elimination**:
- Kidney excretion (urine)
- Complete elimination
- No accumulation in body

### Individual Variation

**Factors Affecting Response**:
- Body weight (larger people process more)
- Genetics (metabolism speed)
- Tolerance (regular use)
- Timing (time of day, circadian rhythm)
- Other medications

**Genetic Differences**:
- Some people fast metabolizers
- Others slow metabolizers
- CYP1A2 gene variants
- Explains different sensitivity

## Health Considerations

### Benefits

**Research-Supported Benefits**:
- Reduced risk of Parkinson's disease
- Lower diabetes risk
- Liver protection (cirrhosis reduction)
- Cognitive function enhancement
- Athletic performance benefits

**Safe Consumption**:
- Up to 400mg/day generally safe (FDA)
- Individual variation in sensitivity
- Pregnant women: Lower limits recommended

### Concerns

**Side Effects** (high intake):
- Anxiety, jitters
- Insomnia (timing matters)
- Heart palpitations
- Withdrawal headaches

**Who Should Limit**:
- People with high blood pressure
- Anxiety disorders
- Sleep problems
- Pregnant women

**Withdrawal**:
- Occurs with regular use then stopping
- Symptoms: Headache, fatigue, mood changes
- Duration: Few days to 2 weeks
- Manageable, not dangerous

## Decaffeination

### Methods

**Swiss Water Process** (chemical-free):
- Green beans soaked in hot water
- Caffeine extracted by water
- Carbon filters remove caffeine from water
- Reuse water for next batch
- Environmentally friendly

**Organic Solvent Method**:
- Dichloromethane or ethyl acetate
- Applied to green beans
- Removes caffeine
- Residual solvents minimal

**CO2 Method**:
- Supercritical carbon dioxide
- Excellent selectivity for caffeine
- Environmentally friendly
- Premium process

### Decaf Caffeine Content

**Requirement**:
- Must remove 97%+ of caffeine (US)
- EU: 99.9% removal required
- Caffeine-free impossible (trace amounts remain)

**Practical Caffeine**:
- Decaf coffee: 2-5mg per 8 oz
- Vastly reduced but not zero
- Safe for most caffeine-sensitive people

## Practical Applications

### For Consumers
