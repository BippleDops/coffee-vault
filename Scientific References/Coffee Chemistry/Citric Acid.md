# 🍋 Citric Acid

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry → Individual Acid Profiles  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Related**: [[Organic Acids]], [[Perceived Acidity]], [[Acids in Coffee]]

---

## 📋 Overview

**Citric Acid** is coffee's most prized organic acid, responsible for bright, clean, lemony acidity that defines specialty coffee quality. It's a primary marker of high-altitude Arabica and associated with exceptional cup quality.

**Content**:
- 0.4-1.2% of bean (varies significantly by origin)
- Highest in high-altitude Arabica
- Relatively stable during roasting
- Positively correlated with perceived quality

## 🔬 Chemical Properties

**Structure**: C₆H₈O₇  
**Type**: Tricarboxylic acid  
**Source**: Natural fruit acid (same as citrus fruits)

**Extraction**:
- Water-soluble
- Extracts early in brewing
- Temperature-sensitive (more at higher temps)
- Mineral-dependent (calcium enhances extraction)

**Stability**:
- Survives light-medium roasting well
- Decreases in dark roasts
- More stable than malic acid
- Degrades above 200°C

---

## 👅 Flavor Profile

**Primary Characteristics**:
- **Flavor**: Lemon, lime, bright citrus
- **Character**: Clean, refreshing, vibrant
- **Quality**: Desirable, high-value
- **Association**: Premium coffee indicator

**Sensory Impact**:
- Creates "brightness" or "liveliness"
- Clean, crisp finish
- Pleasant tartness
- Enhances fruit perception

**Comparison**:
- More stable than [[Malic Acid]]
- More desirable than [[Quinic Acid]]
- Creates sharper profile than [[Phosphoric Acid]]
- Higher quality marker than [[Acetic Acid]]

## 🌍 Origin Patterns

**Highest Citric Acid**:
- **Ethiopian Washed**: 1.0-1.2% - Signature brightness
- **Kenyan**: 0.8-1.1% - Complex acidity foundation
- **Rwandan**: 0.8-1.0% - Bright, wine-like
- **Burundian**: 0.7-1.0% - Clean, citrusy

**High Citric Acid**:
- **Central American**: 0.6-0.9% - Consistent brightness
- **Colombian**: 0.6-0.8% - Balanced, pleasant
- **Costa Rican**: 0.7-0.9% - Crisp, clean
- **Guatemalan**: 0.6-0.8% - Fruity brightness

**Lower Citric Acid**:
- **Brazilian**: 0.3-0.5% - Smooth, low-acid
- **Sumatran**: 0.3-0.5% - Earthy, muted
- **Indonesian**: 0.2-0.4% - Low brightness

## 🔥 Roasting Impact

**Light Roast**:
- **Citric Acid**: High preservation (90-95%)
- **Effect**: Very bright, citrusy, vibrant
- **Character**: Tea-like, sparkling
- **Application**: Premium single-origin specialty

**Medium Roast**:
- **Citric Acid**: Moderate preservation (70-80%)
- **Effect**: Bright, balanced, approachable
- **Character**: Pleasant citrus, less sharp
- **Application**: Blend-friendly, daily drinker

**Dark Roast**:
- **Citric Acid**: Significant degradation (40-60% loss)
- **Effect**: Less bright, more chocolatey
- **Character**: Muted citrus, roast flavors dominant
- **Application**: Espresso, milk drinks

## 💧 Extraction Control

**Temperature**:
- **Higher (95-100°C)**: More extraction → Brighter, sharper
- **Lower (85-92°C)**: Less extraction → Smoother
- **Optimal**: 92-96°C for light-medium roasts

**Brew Time**:
- **Shorter**: Less citric → Flatter profile
- **Longer**: More citric → Potentially sour if overdone
- **Balance**: Extract early for brightness, but stop before quinic

**Water Chemistry**:
- **Calcium**: Enhances citric extraction → More brightness
- **Magnesium**: Also effective for citric → Amplifies citrus
- **Alkalinity**: High alkalinity neutralizes → Muted brightness

## 🎯 Quality Indicator

**Why Citric = Quality**:
1. **Growing Conditions**: High altitude (stresses bean development)
2. **Variety Selection**: Arabica specialty cultivars
3. **Processing**: Proper fermentation preserves acids
4. **Freshness**: Citric degrades with age

**Industry Recognition**:
- SCA scoring rewards citric brightness
- Specialty prices correlate with citric content
- Coffee competitions favor citric-driven profiles
- Consumer perception: "bright = premium"
