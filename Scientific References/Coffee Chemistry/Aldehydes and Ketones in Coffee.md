# 🧪 Aldehydes and Ketones in Coffee

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand aldehydes and ketones' aromatic contributions

---

## 📋 Overview

Aldehydes and ketones are volatile carbonyl compounds creating coffee's fruity, floral, malty, and buttery aromas - formed during roasting through Maillard reactions and lipid oxidation. Understanding these compounds explains fresh coffee aroma and staling mechanisms.

**Aldehydes**:
- **Fruity, Floral, Fresh**: Apple, cherry, floral notes
- **Examples**: Acetaldehyde (fruity), benzaldehyde (almond), furfural (sweet)
- **Staling**: Increase during staling (lipid oxidation creates stale aldehydes)

**Ketones**:
- **Butter, Cream, Sweet**: Buttery, creamy, caramel notes
- **Examples**: Diacetyl (butter), acetoin (butter/cream)
- **Formation**: Maillard reactions, lipid breakdown

## 🔬 Fresh vs. Stale

**Fresh Coffee**:
- **Desirable Aldehydes**: Fruity, floral (benzaldehyde, etc.)
- **Balanced**: Pleasant aroma profile

**Stale Coffee**:
- **Oxidation Aldehydes**: Cardboard, rancid, stale
- **Unpleasant**: Off-aromas from oxidation
- **Degradation**: Fresh aldehydes oxidize to unpleasant compounds

## 📝 Summary

Aldehydes (fruity, floral, malty) and ketones (buttery, creamy) create coffee's volatile aroma profile through Maillard reactions - fresh coffee contains desirable aldehydes (benzaldehyde, furfural) while stale coffee develops unpleasant oxidation aldehydes (cardboard, rancid) from lipid degradation.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Aldehydes**: Fruity, floral aromas (fresh); cardboard, stale (oxidized)
- **Ketones**: Butter, cream, sweet aromas
- **Fresh**: Desirable aldehydes/ketones from roasting
- **Stale**: Oxidation creates unpleasant aldehydes
