# 🧪 Organic Acids

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Related**: [[Perceived Acidity]], [[Acids in Coffee]], [[Chlorogenic Acids and Antioxidants]]

---

## 📋 Overview

**Organic Acids** are carbon-based acidic compounds that fundamentally shape coffee's flavor profile, contributing to brightness, complexity, and perceived quality. These compounds are responsible for the vibrant, lively sensation we call "acidity" in coffee tasting.

**Key Insight**: Not all acids taste the same. The *type* of organic acid matters more than the total acid content for perceived acidity.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

Coffee contains **30+ organic acids**, each with distinct flavor characteristics:

**Most Important Organic Acids**:
1. [[Citric Acid]] - Bright, lemony, clean
2. [[Malic Acid]] - Apple-like, fruity
3. [[Quinic Acid]] - Bitter-sour (from roasting)
4. [[Chlorogenic Acids]] - Antioxidant-rich parent compounds
5. [[Phosphoric Acid]] - Soft, sweet (Kenyan signature)
6. [[Acetic Acid]] - Vinegar-like (fermentation byproduct)
7. [[Tartaric Acid]] - Wine-like

**Total Acid Content**:
- Green Coffee: 6-9% by weight
- Roasted Coffee: 5-7% by weight
- Brewed Coffee: pH 4.8-5.2

## 🔬 Individual Acid Characteristics

### [[Citric Acid]]

**Flavor**: Lemon, lime, bright citrus  
**Character**: Clean, refreshing, vibrant  
**Common in**: Ethiopian washed, Kenyan, Central American  
**Perception**: Desirable brightness  
**Stability**: Relatively stable during roasting

**Learn More**: [[Citric Acid]]

### [[Malic Acid]]

**Flavor**: Green apple, stone fruit (peach, apricot)  
**Character**: Fruity acidity, pleasant  
**Common in**: Ethiopian, Kenyan, high-altitude coffees  
**Perception**: Fruit-driven acidity  
**Stability**: Decreases with roasting

**Learn More**: [[Malic Acid]]

### [[Quinic Acid]]

**Flavor**: Sour, bitter, astringent  
**Source**: [[Chlorogenic Acids]] breakdown during roasting  
**Increases**: With roast level (highest in dark roasts)  
**Perception**: Undesirable when dominant  
**Effect**: "Old coffee" bitterness

**Learn More**: [[Quinic Acid]]

### [[Phosphoric Acid]]

**Flavor**: Soft, round, sweet acidity  
**Character**: Gentle, wine-like  
**Common in**: Kenyan coffee (volcanic soil phosphorus)  
**Perception**: Desirable, sophisticated  
**Unique**: Enhances Kenyan distinctiveness

**Learn More**: [[Phosphoric Acid]]

## ☕ Origin Acid Profiles

Different growing regions produce distinct organic acid compositions:

**Kenya**: Citric + Malic + **Phosphoric** (unique) = Complex bright acidity  
**Ethiopia**: Citric + Malic = Bright, fruity  
**Colombia**: Citric + Malic (balanced) = Pleasant brightness  
**Brazil**: Low citric/malic = Smooth, low-acid  
**Costa Rica**: Balanced citric = Clean, crisp  
**Guatemala**: Malic + Citric = Fruity brightness

## 🔥 Roasting Impact

**Light Roast**:
- High [[Citric Acid]]
- High [[Malic Acid]]
- Low [[Quinic Acid]]
- Result: Very bright, crisp acidity

**Medium Roast**:
- Moderate [[Citric Acid]] and [[Malic Acid]]
- Moderate [[Quinic Acid]] formation
- Result: Balanced brightness

**Dark Roast**:
- Low [[Citric Acid]] and [[Malic Acid]] (degraded)
- High [[Quinic Acid]] (breakdown product)
- Result: Less bright, more bitter

## 💧 Extraction Impact

**Temperature**:
- Higher temperature (95-100°C): More acid extraction, brighter cup
- Lower temperature (85-92°C): Less acid extraction, smoother cup

**Brew Time**:
- Over-extraction: Too much [[Quinic Acid]] → Astringent, harsh
- Under-extraction: Insufficient acid extraction → Flat, dull
- Optimal: Balanced acid extraction → Brightness without harshness

---

## 🌊 Water Chemistry Interaction

**Alkalinity**:
- High alkalinity (>100 ppm): Neutralizes acids → Dull, flat
- Low alkalinity (<30 ppm): Harsh acidity
- Optimal (40-75 ppm): Balanced [[Perceived Acidity]]

**Minerals**:
- [[Calcium and Magnesium Roles in Extraction|Calcium & Magnesium]]: Enhance acid extraction
- Appropriate hardness: Amplifies brightness

## 📊 Practical Applications

**For Roasters**:
- Control acid profile through roast level
- Match roast to origin characteristics
- Balance brightness with sweetness

**For Baristas**:
- Temperature control critical for acidity
- Light roasts need careful extraction
- Avoid over-extraction (quinic acid)

**For Tasters**:
- Identify acid types in cupping
- Understand origin differences
- Appreciate balance
