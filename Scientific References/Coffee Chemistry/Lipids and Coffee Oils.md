# 🧈 Lipids and Coffee Oils

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand coffee oils, their effects on flavor and health

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee contains 10-17% lipids (oils) that affect body, mouthfeel, flavor, and health - with paper filters removing most oils while metal filters retain them, creating fundamental flavor differences between brewing methods. Understanding lipids explains French Press richness, paper filter clarity, and cholesterol concerns with unfiltered coffee.

**Coffee Lipids**:
- **Content**: 10-17% of roasted coffee (dry weight)
- **Location**: Stored in bean's cell structures, released when ground
- **Solubility**: Not water-soluble (that's why oils float on espresso)
- **Extraction**: Grinding releases, brewing methods determine retention

**Major Components**:
- **Triglycerides**: 75% of lipids, neutral fats
- **Diterpenes**: Cafestol, kahweol (biologically active, health concerns)
- **Free Fatty Acids**: Contribute to flavor, staling

## 🔬 Diterpenes (Cafestol, Kahweol)

**Biologically Active**:
- **Cafestol**: Primary diterpene, raises cholesterol
- **Kahweol**: Similar to cafestol, less abundant
- **Health**: Increase LDL cholesterol (well-established)
- **Amount**: 0.2-0.6% of coffee
- **Paper Filters**: Remove ~80-90% diterpenes
- **Metal Filters**: Retain ~100% diterpenes

**French Press Cholesterol Concern**:
- **Unfiltered**: Retains all diterpenes (cafestol, kahweol)
- **Effect**: Daily unfiltered coffee can raise cholesterol 8-10%
- **Solution**: Paper-filtered coffee (removes diterpenes)
- **Moderate**: Occasional French Press fine, daily may be concern

## ☕ Brewing Method Effects

**Paper Filter** (V60, Chemex, Drip):
- **Removes Oils**: 80-90% lipid removal
- **Result**: Clean, bright, light-bodied, no cholesterol concern

**Metal Filter** (French Press, Metal Pour-Over):
- **Retains Oils**: ~100% lipid retention
- **Result**: Full body, rich, coating, cholesterol concern if daily

**Espresso** (Crema = Oils):
- **Some Oils**: Concentrated, crema is emulsified oils
- **Moderate**: Small volume limits diterpene intake

## 📝 Summary

Coffee lipids (10-17% of bean) affect body, mouthfeel, and health - paper filters remove oils creating clean, bright cups without cholesterol concern; metal filters retain oils creating rich, full-bodied coffee with diterpenes (cafestol/kahweol) that raise cholesterol. Understanding lipid retention explains brewing method body differences and health considerations.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Lipids**: 10-17% of coffee, affect body/mouthfeel
- **Diterpenes**: Cafestol/kahweol raise cholesterol
- **Paper Filters**: Remove oils, no cholesterol concern
- **Metal Filters**: Retain oils, cholesterol consideration
- **Moderate**: Daily unfiltered may affect cholesterol
