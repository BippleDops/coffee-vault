# 🍬 Sugar Degradation and Caramelization in Roasting

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand how sugars transform during roasting

---

## 📋 Overview

Sugars in coffee undergo dramatic transformations during roasting - from simple sweetness in green beans to complex caramel flavors through caramelization, Maillard reactions, and thermal decomposition. Understanding sugar chemistry explains coffee's sweetness development, roast flavor creation, and why roast level dramatically affects perceived sweetness.

**Sugars in Green Coffee**:
- **Sucrose**: 6-9% (dominant sugar in Arabica)
- **Reducing Sugars**: Glucose, fructose (1-2%)
- **Total**: 7-11% sugars (dry weight)
- **Robusta**: Lower sucrose (3-7%)

**What Happens During Roasting**:
- **Degradation**: Sugars break down progressively
- **Caramelization**: Heat-induced sugar breakdown (>160°C/320°F)
- **Maillard**: Sugars react with amino acids (browning)
- **Byproducts**: Caramel flavors, brown colors, CO₂, water

**Roast Level Sugar Content**:
- **Green**: 7-11% total sugars
- **Light Roast**: 4-6% remaining
- **Medium Roast**: 1-3% remaining  
- **Dark Roast**: <1% remaining
- **Trend**: More roasting = less sugar (degradation)

## 🔬 Caramelization Chemistry

**Process**:
- **Temperature**: 160-180°C+ (320-356°F+)
- **Reaction**: Sucrose breaks down (heat-induced decomposition)
- **Products**: 
  - Caramel compounds (flavor)
  - Brown pigments (color)
  - CO₂, water (gases)
  - Acids (contribute to acidity)

**Caramel Flavor Development**:
- **Light Caramelization**: Butterscotch, toffee, brown sugar
- **Medium**: Caramel, molasses, deeper sweetness
- **Heavy**: Burnt sugar, bitter-sweet, char

**Roast Level Impact**:
- **Light Roast**: Minimal caramelization, residual sugar sweetness
- **Medium Roast**: Optimal caramelization, balanced caramel flavors
- **Dark Roast**: Heavy caramelization, bitter-sweet, burnt sugar

## 💡 Sweetness Perception by Roast

**Light Roast Sweetness**:
- **Source**: Residual sugars (4-6% remaining)
- **Character**: Clean, simple sweetness
- **Perception**: Sweet but not caramel-sweet

**Medium Roast Sweetness** ⭐ **Peak**:
- **Source**: Caramel compounds + residual sugars
- **Character**: Complex caramel-toffee-brown sugar sweetness
- **Perception**: Maximum perceived sweetness (balance of sources)

**Dark Roast Sweetness**:
- **Source**: Caramel compounds only (sugars depleted)
- **Character**: Bitter-sweet, roast sweetness
- **Perception**: Less sweet overall, different character

**Key Insight**: Medium roasts often perceived as sweetest (caramelization peak before sugar depletion)

## 📝 Summary

Coffee sugars (6-9% sucrose in green beans) degrade during roasting through caramelization (heat breakdown) and Maillard reactions (amino acid interaction), transforming simple sweetness into complex caramel flavors while depleting total sugar content. Light roasts retain most sugar (4-6%), medium roasts balance caramel and residual sugar (peak perceived sweetness), dark roasts deplete sugar (<1%) leaving bitter-sweet roast character.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Green Coffee**: 6-9% sucrose (Arabica)
- **Caramelization**: >160°C, creates caramel flavors
- **Roast Depletion**: Light (4-6%), Medium (1-3%), Dark (<1%)
- **Peak Sweetness**: Medium roasts (caramel + residual sugar)
- **Dark Roasts**: Sugar depleted, bitter-sweet character
