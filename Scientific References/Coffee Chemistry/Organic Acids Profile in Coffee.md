# 🧪 Organic Acids Profile in Coffee

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Purpose**: Understand acids responsible for coffee's acidity and flavor

---

## 📋 Overview

Coffee contains numerous [[Organic Acids]] contributing to [[Perceived Acidity]], brightness, flavor complexity, and mouthfeel. Understanding which acids create which sensory experiences enables informed choices about origin, roast level, and brewing methods to achieve desired acidity balance.

**Major Coffee Acids**:
1. **Chlorogenic Acids (CGAs)**: 4-8% of green coffee, decrease in roasting
2. **Citric Acid**: Bright, lemony, clean acidity
3. **Malic Acid**: Apple-like, stone fruit acidity
4. **Quinic Acid**: Bitter-sour, increases with roasting (from CGA breakdown)
5. **Acetic Acid**: Vinegar-like (fermentation byproduct, low in quality coffee)
6. **Phosphoric Acid**: Soft, sweet acidity (Kenyan signature)
7. **Tartaric Acid**: Wine-like acidity (grape)

**Total Acidity**:
- **Green Coffee**: 6-9% total acids (dry weight)
- **Roasted Coffee**: 5-7% (some degradation)
- **Brewed Coffee**: pH 4.8-5.2 (acidic)

## 🔬 Individual Acid Profiles

**Citric Acid** (Bright, Clean):
- **Flavor**: Lemon, lime, bright citrus
- **Character**: Clean, refreshing, vibrant
- **Common**: Ethiopian washed, Kenyan, Central American
- **Perception**: Desirable brightness
- **Roasting**: Relatively stable, decreases moderately

**Malic Acid** (Fruity, Apple-Like):
- **Flavor**: Green apple, stone fruit (peach, apricot)
- **Character**: Fruity acidity, pleasant
- **Common**: Ethiopian, Kenyan, high-altitude coffees
- **Perception**: Fruit-driven acidity
- **Roasting**: Decreases with roasting

**Quinic Acid** (Bitter-Sour):
- **Flavor**: Sour, bitter, astringent
- **Source**: Chlorogenic acid breakdown during roasting
- **Increases**: With roast level (highest in dark roasts)
- **Perception**: Undesirable when dominant
- **Effect**: "Old coffee" bitterness

**Phosphoric Acid** (Soft, Sweet):
- **Flavor**: Soft, round, sweet acidity
- **Character**: Gentle, wine-like
- **Common**: Kenyan coffee (volcanic soil phosphorus)
- **Perception**: Desirable, sophisticated
- **Unique**: Enhances Kenyan distinctiveness

## ☕ Origin Acid Profiles

**Kenya**: Citric + Malic + **Phosphoric** (unique) = Complex bright acidity  
**Ethiopia**: Citric + Malic = Bright, fruity  
**Colombia**: Citric + Malic (balanced) = Pleasant brightness  
**Brazil**: Low citric/malic = Smooth, low-acid

## 📝 Summary

Coffee's acidity comes from multiple [[Organic Acids]] - citric (bright, clean), malic (fruity), quinic (bitter-sour, increases with roasting), phosphoric (soft, Kenyan), and others. Understanding acid profiles explains why origins taste different and how roasting/brewing affects [[Perceived Acidity]].

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Citric**: Bright, lemony, clean (desirable)
- **Malic**: Apple-like, fruity (desirable)
- **Quinic**: Bitter-sour from roasting (less desirable)
- **Phosphoric**: Soft, sweet (Kenyan signature)
- **Roasting**: Decreases good acids, increases quinic
- **Origins**: Different acid profiles create distinct characters
