# 🧪 Caffeine Extraction and Content in Coffee

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Purpose**: Understand caffeine content, extraction, and factors affecting levels

---

## 📋 Overview

Caffeine is coffee's most famous compound - the stimulant alkaloid that provides coffee's energizing effects and contributes to flavor through mild bitterness. Understanding caffeine content across origins, roast levels, and brewing methods enables informed choices about coffee consumption and debunks common myths about caffeine levels.

**Caffeine Basics**:
- **Chemical**: Alkaloid (methylxanthine), molecular formula C₈H₁₀N₄O₂
- **Function**: Plant defense compound (insecticidal), stimulates humans
- **Content**: 0.8-2.5% of green coffee bean dry weight (varies widely)
- **Taste**: Bitter (contributes ~10-15% of coffee's bitterness)
- **Extraction**: Highly soluble in hot water (easily extracted)
- **Stability**: Stable during roasting (minimal degradation)

**Common Myths Debunked**:
❌ **"Dark roast has more caffeine"**: FALSE (light roasts have slightly more)  
❌ **"Espresso has most caffeine"**: FALSE per volume (true per ounce, false per cup)  
❌ **"Decaf has zero caffeine"**: FALSE (3-7mg per cup remains)  
❌ **"Robusta is stronger"**: TRUE for caffeine (2x Arabica), false for flavor intensity

## 📊 Caffeine Content by Species

**Arabica**: 0.8-1.4% caffeine (dry weight)
- **Typical**: ~1.2% (12mg per gram of coffee)
- **Range**: 0.8-1.4% depending on variety, origin

**Robusta**: 1.7-2.5% caffeine
- **Typical**: ~2.2% (22mg per gram)
- **Double**: ~2x Arabica content

**Liberica**: 1.2-1.5% caffeine

**Why Robusta Has More**:
- Evolutionary defense (lower altitude, more pests)
- Genetic difference (different species)

## ☕ Caffeine Content by Brew Method

**Typical Serving Sizes & Caffeine**:

| Method | Serving | Coffee Used | Caffeine |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Espresso** | 1 oz (30ml) | 18-20g | 60-80mg |
| **Drip Coffee** | 8 oz (240ml) | 12-15g | 95-140mg |
| **Pour Over** | 10 oz (300ml) | 20g | 150-180mg |
| **French Press** | 8 oz | 15g | 100-150mg |
| **Cold Brew** | 8 oz | Varies | 150-300mg (conc.) |

**Key Insight**: Serving size matters more than concentration

**Espresso Myth**:
- **Per ounce**: Espresso highest (60-80mg/oz)
- **Per serving**: Drip/Pour-over higher (larger servings)
- **Reality**: 1 oz espresso < 8 oz drip coffee (caffeine total)

---

## 🔥 Roast Level & Caffeine

**Myth**: "Dark roast has less caffeine (burned off)"

**Reality**: Minimal difference
- **Light Roast**: ~1.2-1.3% caffeine (by weight)
- **Dark Roast**: ~1.1-1.2% caffeine
- **Difference**: ~5-10% reduction (negligible)

**Why Confusion**:
- **By Volume**: Dark roast less dense (expanded beans) = slightly less caffeine per scoop
- **By Weight**: Virtually identical
- **Practical**: Difference too small to matter

**Verdict**: Roast level doesn't significantly affect caffeine

## 📝 Summary

Caffeine content varies by species (Robusta 2x Arabica), remains stable across roast levels (minimal degradation), and varies by serving size more than brew method concentration. Understanding caffeine enables informed choices about consumption while debunking persistent myths.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Arabica**: ~1.2% caffeine (~120mg per 10g coffee)
- **Robusta**: ~2.2% caffeine (~220mg per 10g)
- **Roast**: Minimal effect (myth debunked)
- **Serving Size**: Matters most for caffeine intake
- **Espresso**: High concentration, small serving = moderate total caffeine
