# 🍎 Malic Acid

**Category**: Coffee Chemistry → Individual Acid Profiles  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Related**: [[Organic Acids]], [[Perceived Acidity]], [[Citric Acid]]

---

## 📋 Overview

**Malic Acid** creates pleasant, fruity acidity in coffee with apple-like, stone fruit characteristics. Working alongside [[Citric Acid]], it contributes to the complex brightness that defines high-quality specialty coffee.

**Content**:
- 0.3-0.8% of bean
- Present in all coffees
- Natural fruit acid (same as apples)
- Pleasant, approachable tartness

---

## 🔬 Chemical Properties

**Structure**: C₄H₆O₅  
**Type**: Dicarboxylic acid  
**Source**: Natural fruit acid (apples, grapes)

**Extraction**:
- Water-soluble
- Extracts with citric acid
- Temperature-sensitive
- Mineral-enhanced extraction

**Stability**:
- Moderately stable during roasting
- More stable than acetic acid
- Less stable than citric acid
- Survives light-medium roast

---

## 👅 Flavor Profile

**Primary Characteristics**:
- **Flavor**: Green apple, tart stone fruit (peach, apricot)
- **Character**: Fruity acidity, pleasant, smooth
- **Quality**: Desirable, high-value
- **Association**: Natural, fruity complexity

**Sensory Impact**:
- Rounded, pleasant tartness
- Enhances fruit perception
- Smooth, non-harsh acidity
- Adds complexity to brightness

**Comparison**:
- Softer than [[Citric Acid]] (less sharp)
- More pleasant than [[Quinic Acid]] (non-bitter)
- More complex than acetic (not sharp/vinegary)
- Works in harmony with citric

## 🌍 Origin Patterns

**Notable Malic Acid**:
- **Colombian**: Good malic presence - Clean, fruity
- **Guatemalan**: Notable malic - Balanced brightness
- **Costa Rican**: Good malic - Crisp, apple-like
- **Ethiopian**: Present with citric - Complex fruity brightness

**Central American Pattern**:
- Consistently good malic acid levels
- Contributes to "clean" cup profile
- Complements citric for balanced brightness
- Approachable, pleasant acidity

**Regional Comparison**:
- Central American: Higher malic → Fruity, clean
- East African: High citric, moderate malic → Bright, wine-like
- South American: Lower overall → Muted, smooth

## 🔥 Roasting Impact

**Light Roast**:
- **Malic Acid**: High preservation (85-90%)
- **Effect**: Bright, fruity, apple-like
- **Character**: Sparkling, natural fruit notes
- **Application**: Single-origin specialty

**Medium Roast**:
- **Malic Acid**: Moderate preservation (60-70%)
- **Effect**: Pleasant, rounded tartness
- **Character**: Balanced fruity notes
- **Application**: Daily drinker, approachable

**Dark Roast**:
- **Malic Acid**: Significant degradation (40-50% loss)
- **Effect**: Muted, less fruity
- **Character**: Roast flavors dominate
- **Application**: Espresso, milk drinks

## 💧 Extraction Control

**Temperature**:
- **Higher (95-100°C)**: More malic extraction → Brighter, fruitier
- **Lower (85-92°C)**: Less malic extraction → Smoother, less fruity
- **Optimal**: 90-94°C for balanced fruit notes

**Brew Time**:
- **Shorter**: Less malic → Flatter, less complex
- **Longer**: More malic → Can enhance fruit notes
- **Balance**: Extract for fruit complexity

**Water Chemistry**:
- **Calcium**: Enhances malic extraction → More fruit notes
- **Magnesium**: Effective for malic → Amplifies apple-like
- **Alkalinity**: Neutralizes → Reduces fruit perception

## 🎯 Quality & Complexity

**Why Malic Adds Value**:
1. **Complexity**: Layers with citric for depth
2. **Approachability**: Less sharp than pure citric
3. **Naturalness**: Fruit-like associations
4. **Balance**: Rounds out acidity profile

**Industry Recognition**:
- Complements citric in quality coffees
- Enhances sensory complexity
- Contributes to positive cupping notes
- Desirable in specialty coffee
