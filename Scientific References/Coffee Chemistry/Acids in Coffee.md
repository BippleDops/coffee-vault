# Acids in Coffee - Complete Chemistry Guide

## Overview

Acidity is one of coffee's most important flavor characteristics. Multiple organic acids contribute to coffee's brightness, complexity, and perceived quality. Understanding these acids illuminates roasting, brewing, and tasting.

## Major Organic Acids

### Chlorogenic Acid

**Content**:
- Green beans: 6-12% by weight
- Most abundant acid in green coffee
- Degrades during roasting

**Characteristics**:
- Bitter and astringent
- Antioxidant properties
- Decreases with roasting

**Roast Impact**:
- Light roast: High chlorogenic acid
- Dark roast: Low chlorogenic acid (breakdown)
- Degradation starts around 200°C

### Quinic Acid

**Origin**:
- Breakdown product of chlorogenic acid
- Increases during roasting
- Component of chlorogenic acid molecule

**Characteristics**:
- Sour, astringent taste
- Responsible for "coffee bitterness" in stale coffee
- Increases with roast level

**Staling Role**:
- Forms quinic acid lactones
- Creates cardboard, stale flavor
- Indicator of oxidation

### Citric Acid

**Content**:
- 0.4-1.2% of bean (varies by origin)
- Highest in high-altitude Arabica
- Associated with quality

**Characteristics**:
- Bright, lemony, crisp
- Desirable acidity
- Fresh, clean perception

**Origin Patterns**:
- Ethiopian: Very high citric acid
- Kenyan: High citric acid
- Brazilian: Lower citric acid
- Correlates with perceived quality

**Stability**:
- Relatively stable during roasting
- Survives to medium roast
- Decreases in dark roasts

### Malic Acid

**Content**:
- 0.3-0.8% of bean
- Present in all coffees
- Natural fruit acid

**Characteristics**:
- Apple-like, tart
- Smooth, round acidity
- Pleasant sharpness

**Origin Patterns**:
- Central American: Notable malic
- Colombian: Good malic presence
- Contributes to "clean" cup profile

**Stability**:
- Moderately stable
- Survives to medium roast
- Lost in dark roasts

### Acetic Acid

**Content**:
- 0.1-0.3% typically
- Formed during roasting and processing

**Characteristics**:
- Vinegar-like aroma
- Sharp, pungent
- Can be defect or character (context-dependent)

**Formation**:
- Some in green beans
- Increases during roasting
- Can form during fermentation (processing)

**Quality Indicator**:
- Low levels: Can add complexity
- High levels: Defect (over-fermentation)
- Balance is key

### Phosphoric Acid

**Content**:
- Rare in coffee
- When present: Associated with quality

**Characteristics**:
- Round, sweet acidity
- Soda-like brightness
- Very desirable

**Origin Patterns**:
- Kenyan coffees particularly known for this
- SL-28, SL-34 varieties
- Wet-washed processing
- High-altitude

**Value**:
- Highly prized characteristic
- Premium pricing
- Specialty coffee marker

### Lactic Acid

**Content**:
- Minimal in green beans
- Can form during processing

**Characteristics**:
- Creamy, milk-like acidity
- Smooth, round
- Yogurt associations

**Origin**:
- Fermentation during processing
- Controlled anaerobic fermentation
- Some natural processing

**Modern Trends**:
- Intentional lactic development
- Experimental processing
- Sought after characteristic

## Roasting Impact on Acids

### Light Roast

**Acid Profile**:
- High chlorogenic (bitter-sour)
- High citric (bright)
- High malic (fruity)
- Low quinic (minimal breakdown)
- Clean, bright acidity

**Perception**:
- Very bright, crisp
- Can be sour if under-developed
- Citrus-forward
- Tea-like at times

### Medium Roast

**Acid Profile**:
- Moderate chlorogenic (degrading)
- Good citric (preserved)
- Good malic (preserved)
- Moderate quinic (some formation)
- Balanced acidity

**Perception**:
- Balanced brightness
- Less sharp
- Rounded acidity
- Pleasant tartness

### Dark Roast

**Acid Profile**:
- Low chlorogenic (degraded)
- Low citric (degraded)
- Low malic (degraded)
- High quinic (breakdown product)
- Overall lower acidity perception

**Perception**:
- Less bright
- Bitterness dominant
- Heavy body
- Low acidity

## Perceived Acidity vs pH

### pH Measurement

**Coffee pH**:
- Black coffee: 4.85-5.10 (slightly acidic)
- Espresso: 5.0-5.2
- Cold brew: 5.5-6.0 (less acidic pH)

**Comparison**:
- Water: pH 7.0 (neutral)
- Cola: pH 2.5 (much more acidic)
- Orange juice: pH 3.5
- Coffee is mildly acidic by pH

### Perceived vs Actual Acidity

**Discrepancy**:
- pH doesn't predict perceived acidity well
- Organic acid types matter more than total
- Sensory perception complex
- Multiple factors interact

**What Matters**:
- Type of acids (citric vs quinic)
- Concentration of each
- Balance with other flavors
- Temperature of coffee

## Brewing Impact on Acidity

### Extraction Temperature

**Higher Temperature** (95-100°C):
- More acid extraction
- Brighter cup
- Can be overly acidic

**Lower Temperature** (85-92°C):
- Less acid extraction
- Smoother cup
- Less bright

**Optimal**:
- Light roast: 92-95°C
- Medium roast: 90-94°C
- Dark roast: 88-92°C

### Brew Time

**Over-Extraction**:
- Too much quinic acid
- Astringent, harsh
- Unpleasant sourness

**Under-Extraction**:
- Insufficient acid extraction
- Flat, dull cup
- Salty notes

**Sweet Spot**:
- Balanced acid extraction
- Brightness without harshness
- Pleasant, clean acidity

## Health Considerations

### Stomach Sensitivity

**Why Coffee Can Upset Stomach**:
- Acidity stimulates gastric acid production
- Chlorogenic acid effects
- Individual sensitivity varies

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Choose dark roast (lower chlorogenic)
- Cold brew (lower acidity)
- Drink with food
- Avoid on empty stomach

**Low-Acid Options**:
- Dark roasts
- Cold brew
- Some naturally low-acid origins (Brazilian)
- Acid-reducing products available

### Dental Considerations

**Enamel Effects**:
- Acidic beverages can erode enamel
- Coffee relatively mild (compared to soda)
- Frequency more important than pH

**Best Practices**:
- Don't sip continuously
- Rinse mouth after
- Wait before brushing teeth
- Overall impact minimal with moderation

## Acid Balance in Quality Coffee

### Desirable Acidity

**Positive Characteristics**:
- "Brightness" or "liveliness"
- Complexity
- Cleanliness
- Fruit-like notes
- Balance with sweetness

**Quality Indicators**:
- Type of acidity (phosphoric > citric > malic > acetic > quinic)
- Intensity appropriate to origin
- Well-integrated (not dominating)
- Pleasant, not sour

### Undesirable Acidity

**Negative Characteristics**:
- Sourness (acetic, quinic)
- Astringency
- Imbalance
- Harsh, biting

**Causes**:
- Under-roasting
- Over-fermentation
- Staling
- Poor brewing (under-extraction)

## Practical Applications

### For Roasters

**Acidity Management**:
- Roast level controls acid profile
- Development time matters
- Target origin characteristics
- Balance brightness with sweetness

**Origin Selection**:
- High-altitude = more citric
- African = brighter
- Brazilian = lower acid
- Match to customer preference

### For Baristas

**Brewing for Acidity**:
- Temperature control critical
- Light roasts need careful extraction
- Avoid over-extraction (quinic)
- Fresh coffee higher quality acids

**Customer Guidance**:
- Explain acidity as positive
- Offer different acid profiles
- Match preferences to origin/roast

### For Consumers

**Choosing Acidity Level**:
- Prefer brightness? Ethiopian, Kenyan, light roast
- Prefer smooth? Brazilian, dark roast
- Balance? Colombian, medium roast
- Experiment to find preference

## Regional Acid Profiles
