# Java Heirloom Preservation: Historic Varieties and Conservation Efforts

## Overview

Java, Indonesia's historic coffee origin (Dutch colonial introduction 1696), maintains rare Arabica heirloom varieties—Old Java, Java Mocha, estate-grown Typica lineages—threatened by coffee rust outbreaks and modern hybrid replacement. Conservation efforts at historic estates (Djampit, Blawan, Pancoer) preserve 18th-19th century Typica/Bourbon genetics representing unique adaptation to Indonesian terroir and processing methods (wet-hulling/Giling Basah).

## Historical Context

**1696**: Dutch introduce Arabica to Java from Yemen  
**1800s**: Java dominated global coffee trade  
**1876-1890s**: Coffee rust devastates Arabica, shift to Robusta  
**Present**: Small Arabica production, heirloom preservation

## Heirloom Varieties

**Old Java (Typica lineage)**:
- Ancient Typica adaptation to Java terroir
- Flavor: Earthy, spiced, herbal, low acidity, heavy body
- Rarity: Limited estate production

**Java Mocha**:
- Cross-pollination of Typica varieties
- Historic significance: Early trade variety
- Flavor: Complex, spiced, chocolate

## Wet-Hulling (Giling Basah) Processing

**Method**: Remove cherry → ferment → hull at high moisture (30-40%) → final dry  
**Effect**: Creates distinctive Indonesian earthy, herbaceous, spicy profile  
**Reason**: High humidity necessitates rapid drying  
**Impact**: Unique terroir expression (vs. washed Arabica elsewhere)

## Conservation Efforts

- **Historic estates**: Maintain old varieties, traditional processing  
- **Genetic research**: Documenting unique adaptations  
- **Specialty market**: Premium pricing enables preservation  
- **Challenges**: Rust susceptibility, low yields, hybrid pressure

## Summary

- **Java introduced Arabica to Asia (1696 Dutch colonization from Yemen)**: Historic estates maintain 18th-19th century Typica/Bourbon genetics adapted to Indonesian terroir
- **Wet-hulling (Giling Basah) creates distinctive earthy-spicy profile**: High-moisture hulling (30-40%) produces unique flavor unlike washed Arabica—Indonesian terroir signature
- **Coffee rust (1876-1890s) devastated Arabica, enabled Robusta dominance**: Historic varieties rare, limited to estate production (Djampit, Blawan, Pancoer)
- **Heirloom preservation through specialty market**: Premium pricing ($8-15/lb) enables continued cultivation despite low yields and rust susceptibility
