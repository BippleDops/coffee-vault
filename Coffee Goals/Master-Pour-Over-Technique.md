# 🎯 Goal: Master Pour-Over Technique

**Goal Type**: Master Technique
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: High
**Target Date**: 2026-06-30
**Created**: 2025-11-02

---

## 📋 Goal Statement

To achieve mastery of pour-over brewing across multiple methods (V60, Chemex, Kalita Wave) through systematic practice, understanding extraction science, recipe development, and consistent execution of excellent coffee. This includes mastering pour control, understanding grind-to-extraction relationships, developing sensory feedback skills, and producing consistently rated 4.5+/5 coffee across various beans and roast levels.

---

## 💭 Motivation

Pour-over brewing represents the perfect balance of science, technique, and craft. Unlike espresso's intensity or French press's simplicity, pour-over offers control and clarity that rewards skillful execution. Mastering pour-over means understanding extraction deeply and developing precise motor skills.
