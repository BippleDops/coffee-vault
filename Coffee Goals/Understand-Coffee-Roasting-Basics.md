# 🎯 Goal: Understand Coffee Roasting Basics

**Goal Type**: Learning
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: Low
**Target Date**: 2026-12-31
**Created**: 2025-11-02

---

## 📋 Goal Statement

To develop comprehensive understanding of coffee roasting through home roasting exploration, studying roast science, understanding bean development, and experiencing the complete coffee journey from green bean to brewed cup. This goal encompasses learning roasting fundamentals, experimenting with home roasting equipment, understanding roast profiles, recognizing roast defects, and deepening coffee knowledge through hands-on roasting practice.

---

## 💭 Motivation

Understanding roasting completes the coffee knowledge picture. Currently, my coffee journey begins with roasted beans—I understand brewing well but lack knowledge of the critical transformation from green bean to roasted coffee. Learning roasting provides insights into flavor development, unlocks potential cost savings, enables experimentation, and deepens overall coffee expertise.

---

## 🔍 Current State Assessment

**Current Roasting Knowledge**: Minimal
- Understand roasting exists and affects flavor (obvious)
- Basic awareness of roast levels (light, medium, dark)
- Don't understand roast development, chemical changes, or technique
- Never roasted coffee myself
- Don't know how roasting affects flavor beyond general "darker = more roast flavor"

---

## 🎯 Target State

**Roasting Knowledge Mastery**:
- Deep understanding of roasting science (Maillard reaction, first/second crack, etc.)
- Ability to roast coffee at home consistently
- Understanding of roast profiles and their effects
- Recognition of roast defects
- Knowledge of green coffee sourcing and storage
- Teaching capability for roasting basics

---

## 📝 Action Plan

### Phase 1: Roasting Education (Months 1-3)
- Study roasting science (books, videos, courses)
- Learn roast stages, chemical changes, flavor development
- Research home roasting equipment options
- Connect with home roasting community

### Phase 2: Home Roasting Experimentation (Months 4-9)
- Purchase entry-level home roaster ($100-300)
- Source green coffee beans
- Conduct 50+ roasting sessions with documentation
- Experiment with roast profiles
- Develop roasting skills and sensory evaluation

### Phase 3: Advanced Understanding (Months 10-12)
- Deep dive into roast profile design
- Understanding defects and troubleshooting
- Green coffee sourcing knowledge
- Cost/benefit analysis of home roasting
- GOAL ACHIEVED

---

## 🛠️ Resources Needed

**Equipment** (If Pursuing Home Roasting):
- Entry home roaster: $150-300 (Popcorn popper, dedicated home roaster, or pan roasting)
- Green coffee beans: $5-8/lb (vs. $15-22 for roasted)
- Storage for green beans
- Roast logging materials

**Learning Resources**:
- "The Coffee Roaster's Companion" by Scott Rao
- Home roasting forums and communities
- Online courses (Sweet Maria's, others)
- YouTube roasting tutorials

**Time Investment**: 3-5 hours/month learning, 2-4 hours/month roasting practice if pursuing

---

## ⏱️ Timeline & Milestones

- Month 3: Roasting education complete, equipment decisions made
- Month 6: 25+ roasts completed, basic proficiency
- Month 12: 75+ roasts, deep understanding, goal complete

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Knowledge**: Can explain roasting science, stages, and flavor development
**Practice** (if roasting): 50-100 roasts completed and documented
**Understanding**: Recognize roast levels and defects by sight/smell/taste
**Application**: Use roasting knowledge to inform coffee purchasing and brewing

---

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Equipment Cost and Space**
- Home roasters range $150-1000+
- Solution: Start with affordable option (popcorn popper $30 or pan roasting free), assess interest before investing

**Challenge: Smoke and Ventilation**
- Roasting produces smoke
- Solution: Roast outdoors or ensure good ventilation, consider this in equipment/location choices

**Challenge: Green Bean Sourcing**
- Where to buy, how to evaluate, storage
- Solution: Sweet Maria's is excellent beginner source, start with sampler packs

## 📈 Progress Tracking

**Learning Log**: Topics studied, resources consumed, notes
**Roasting Log** (if practicing): Date, bean, roast profile, duration, results, taste notes
**Progress Reviews**: Monthly assessment of knowledge development

## 💬 Notes & Reflections

Roasting is optional but fascinating aspect of coffee. Even without becoming proficient roaster, understanding roasting deepens coffee knowledge and appreciation. The process of transforming green seeds into aromatic brown beans is chemically complex and flavor-defining.

This goal can be pursued at different levels:
- **Minimum**: Study roasting science without practicing (knowledge goal)
- **Moderate**: Experiment with home roasting, 25-50 roasts (exploration goal)
- **Advanced**: Develop home roasting proficiency, 100+ roasts (skill goal)

The comprehensive structure established in earlier goal files (Master-Espresso-Extraction, Complete-SCA-Cupping-Certification, Build-Home-Espresso-Setup) applies here with adaptation for learning-focused rather than skill-mastery goal.
