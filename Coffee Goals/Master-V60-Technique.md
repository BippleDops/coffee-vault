## 💭 Notes & Reflections

**Current State**: Making solid progress. Achieving more consistent results as I refine my technique. Key breakthrough was understanding the importance of bloom saturation and gentle agitation.

**Challenges Faced**:
- Initial struggles with grind size dialing
- Pour control consistency (improving)
- Temperature management (solved with better kettle)
- Understanding bloom dynamics (breakthrough achieved)

**What's Working**:
- Systematic logging of every brew
- Focusing on one bean for initial practice
- Video recording key brews for review
- Measuring extraction yields when possible

**Next Focus Areas**:
1. Perfect the 4-pour technique timing
2. Practice with different roast levels
3. Experiment with pour patterns
4. Reduce brew time variance
5. Achieve flat bed every time

**Motivation**: The improvement is noticeable and rewarding. Each brew is getting better. Excited to achieve mastery level!
