## 📋 Overview

Honduras Marcala Pacas Washed represents the success story of Honduran specialty coffee. Over the past 20 years, Honduras has transformed from an overlooked origin to Central America's largest coffee producer and a specialty coffee powerhouse. Marcala, Honduras's first Denomination of Origin (2005), leads this quality revolution.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Marcala DO**: Honduras's premier coffee region, protected designation
- **Pacas variety**: Compact Bourbon mutation, excellent quality
- **SHG grade**: Strictly High Grown (1,200+ MASL)
- **Washed processing**: Clean, balanced, traditional Central American profile
- **Chocolate-caramel flavor**: Sweet, balanced, approachable
- **Medium-full body**: Satisfying mouthfeel
- **Medium-high acidity**: Bright but balanced
- **Cooperative production**: Strong cooperative tradition
- **Excellent value**: High quality at accessible prices
- **Consistency**: Reliable year-to-year cup profile

Marcala, located in the mountains of La Paz department in southwestern Honduras, has been producing coffee since the late 1800s. Altitude (1,300-1,700+ MASL), climate, soil, and traditional cultivation create ideal conditions for specialty coffee. The region's 2005 Denomination of Origin certification protects and promotes Marcala coffee's reputation.

**Historical Significance**: Honduras surpassed Guatemala in 2011 to become Central America's #1 coffee producer. This growth was driven by quality improvement, cooperative organization, and specialty market development. Marcala led this transformation, becoming the first Honduran coffee region to achieve international quality recognition.

**Misconception Alert**: Some perceive Honduran coffee as commodity-grade due to its historical bulk production. Modern Honduran specialty coffee, especially from Marcala and other designated regions, equals or exceeds neighboring countries' quality. Honduras offers exceptional value—quality comparable to Guatemala or Costa Rica at lower prices.
