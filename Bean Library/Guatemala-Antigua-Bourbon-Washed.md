### Washed Processing Step-by-Step

Antigua's traditional washed processing is critical to the region's quality reputation.

**Stage 1: Reception & Sorting** (Day 1, within 6 hours of picking)

- **Delivery**: Cherries arrive at mill in sacks or trucks
- **Initial inspection**: Visual check for quality, defects
- **Flotation sorting**:
  - Cherries poured into water-filled tanks
  - Ripe beans sink (higher density)
  - Floaters removed (unripe, defective, dried cherries)
  - Debris (leaves, sticks) skimmed off
- **Sorting effectiveness**: Removes 2-5% of delivered cherries
- **Water source**: Spring water or wells (volcanic aquifer, pure)

**Stage 2: Depulping** (Day 1, same day as harvest)

- **Equipment**: Disc depulpers (mechanical)
- **Process**:
  - Cherries fed through adjustable gap between discs
  - Skin and most pulp removed
  - Parchment-covered beans emerge
  - Mucilage layer (pectin) remains attached
- **Quality control**:
  - Unripe beans don't depulp cleanly (easier to sort out)
  - Adjustable settings prevent bean damage
- **By-product management**: Pulp composted for fertilizer
- **Timing critical**: Must occur within 24 hours of picking

**Stage 3: Fermentation** (24-48 hours, Day 1-3)

This is where washed processing creates Antigua's signature clean, bright profile.

- **Method**: Dry fermentation (common in Antigua)
  - Beans in tanks without added water
  - Natural enzymes break down mucilage
  - Exothermic process (generates heat)
- **Alternative**: Wet fermentation (some mills)
  - Beans submerged in water
  - Slower fermentation (cooler)
  - Different flavor development

- **Duration factors**:
  - Temperature: 18-22°C in Antigua (altitude moderates)
  - Altitude: Cooler = slower fermentation (24-48 hours typical)
  - Ambient temperature: Season affects timing
  - Batch size: Larger batches generate more heat
  - Mucilage thickness: Varies with ripeness

- **Monitoring**:
  - Touch test: Mucilage changes from slippery to rough
  - Visual: Color change and texture
  - Water test: Sample washed, check if mucilage releases cleanly
  - Experience: Mill workers sense optimal timing

- **Risks**:
  - **Under-fermentation**: Residual mucilage, hinders drying, potential defects
  - **Over-fermentation**: Vinegar/fermented flavors, stinker beans
  - **Uneven fermentation**: Inconsistent batches

- **Impact on flavor**:
  - Clean fermentation = bright acidity, clarity
  - Optimal fermentation = sweetness development
  - Controlled fermentation = balanced cup

**Stage 4: Washing** (Day 2-3)

- **Purpose**: Remove fermented mucilage completely
- **Method**:
  - Running water channels (traditional Antigua design)
  - Beans agitated in flowing water
  - Multiple rinse cycles
  - Gradient channels (density separation continues)
- **Water requirements**: Large volumes (recycling/treatment critical)
- **Quality check**: Visual inspection for clean parchment
- **Final density sort**: Lighter beans (lower quality) float and are removed
- **Result**: Clean parchment coffee, ready for drying

**Stage 5: Drying** (7-21 days, Day 3-24)

Antigua's climate allows traditional sun-drying during harvest season's dry weather.

**Sun-Drying (Traditional Method)**:
- **Surface**: Patios (concrete), raised beds (some farms), greenhouse dryers
- **Initial thickness**: 2-3 cm layer (thin for even drying)
