## 📋 Overview

Indonesia Sumatra Mandheling Wet-Hulled represents one of the most distinctive and polarizing coffee profiles in the specialty coffee world. This coffee is defined entirely by its unique processing method—Giling Basah (wet-hulling)—which creates a flavor profile so different from other coffees that it has its own devoted following.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Unique wet-hulling (Giling Basah) processing method
- Earthy, herbal, and savory flavor profile
- Full to heavy body with syrupy mouthfeel
- Very low acidity
- Cedar, tobacco, and dark chocolate notes
- Consistent cup profile despite mixed varieties
- Traditional Indonesian coffee style
- Polarizing—loved by some, avoided by others

The Mandheling name refers to the Mandailing people of North Sumatra, though the coffee growing region has expanded beyond their original territory. Located around Lake Toba in North Sumatra, this region produces coffee with such a distinctive character that it has become synonymous with a particular style of coffee appreciated worldwide.

**Historical Significance**: Mandheling coffee has been exported since the Dutch colonial period (1600s-1900s), making it one of the longest-established specialty coffee origins. The wet-hulling process developed as a practical solution to Sumatra's high humidity climate, creating an unintentional flavor profile that has become the region's signature.

**Misconception Alert**: Many coffee professionals initially dismiss Mandheling as "defective" due to flavor notes (earthy, woody, tobacco) that would indicate defects in other coffees. However, these characteristics are intentional results of the wet-hulling process and are highly valued by Mandheling enthusiasts. This is not defective coffee—it's a completely different processing paradigm.

## 🌱 Variety Information: Mixed Heirlooms

### Variety Context in Sumatra

Unlike many specialty coffee regions that emphasize specific varieties, Sumatra Mandheling is typically a mix of traditional varieties planted over decades. The emphasis is on processing and terroir rather than varietal purity.

**Common Varieties in Mandheling**:

1. **Typica** (Original Indonesian coffee)
   - Introduced by Dutch in 1600s-1700s
   - Tall plants, low yield
   - Quality potential high
   - Still found in older plantings

2. **Bergendal/Sidikalang** (Local Typica selections)
   - Adapted to Sumatra conditions
   - Similar to Typica but local selection
   - Named after regions
   - Traditional variety

3. **Ateng/Catimor** (Modern introductions, 1970s+)
   - Hybrid with Robusta genetics (Timor Hybrid)
   - Rust-resistant (critical in humid Sumatra)
   - Higher yielding
   - Lower cup quality than pure Arabica
   - Increasingly common due to economics
   - Controversial in specialty market

4. **Djember/S-lines** (Indonesian research varieties)
   - Developed by Indonesian coffee research
   - Mix of backgrounds
   - Rust resistance breeding focus
   - Variable quality

5. **Bourbon** (Less common)
   - Some farms cultivate
   - Better quality but lower yield
   - Less common than Typica/Ateng

**Why Variety Mixing Occurs**:
- **Historical**: Farms planted over decades with available varieties
- **Economic**: Farmers plant high-yield varieties (Ateng) among traditional
- **Practical**: Mixed planting provides income security
- **Cultural**: Varietal purity not traditional focus
- **Processing**: Wet-hulling process dominates flavor (variety less detectable)

**Grade 1 vs. Varieties**:
- Grade 1 (TP - Triple Picked) indicates defect sorting, not variety
- High-quality Mandheling minimizes Ateng content
- Best lots are Typica/traditional variety dominant
- Variety information often unavailable to buyers
- Processing method more important than variety for Mandheling character

### Plant Characteristics (Typica-dominant lots)

**Tree Morphology**:
- **Height**: 3-4 meters (traditional varieties)
- **Shape**: Tall, conical (Typica lineage)
- **Branching**: Wide branch angles
- **Leaves**: Bronze young leaves (Typica characteristic)
- **Shade tolerance**: Good (traditional agroforestry)

**Cherry & Bean Characteristics**:
- **Cherry size**: Medium to large
- **Cherry color**: Deep red when ripe
- **Beans per cherry**: Typically 2 (peaberry occasional)
- **Bean size**: Medium to large (screen 16-18 common)
- **Bean shape**: Elongated (Typica) or rounder (Ateng)
- **Density**: Good at altitude (not as dense as washed African coffees)

**Yield Characteristics**:
- **Traditional varieties**: Low (Typica 0.5-1 kg/tree)
- **Modern varieties**: Higher (Ateng 1-2 kg/tree)
- **Biennial bearing**: Common (alternate heavy/light years)
- **Sustainability**: Low input requirements in volcanic soil

**Disease Considerations**:
- **Coffee Leaf Rust**: Major issue in humid climate
- **Ateng adoption**: Primarily for rust resistance
- **Traditional varieties**: Require shade and good management
- **Organic methods**: Common (chemicals expensive, organic market demand)

### Wet-Hulling Impact on Variety Expression

**Critical Understanding**:
The wet-hulling (Giling Basah) processing method so dramatically affects flavor that variety characteristics become secondary. A Typica processed via wet-hulling tastes more like an Ateng wet-hulled than a Typica washed.

**Why Processing Dominates**:
- Parchment removal while beans at 40-50% moisture
- Exposed beans absorb environmental influences
- Enzymatic and microbial activity different from washed
- Physical bean damage during hulling affects flavor
- Drying at high moisture creates unique chemistry
- Result: "Mandheling character" regardless of variety

**Variety Still Matters For**:
- Bean size and screen size
- Overall quality potential
- Yield (economic viability)
- Disease resistance
- Subtle cup variation (expert tasters can detect)

## 🔄 Processing: Wet-Hulled Method (Giling Basah)

The Giling Basah (wet-hulling) process is what makes Sumatra Mandheling unique. This processing method exists almost nowhere else in the world and creates a flavor profile unlike any other coffee.

### Why Wet-Hulling Exists

**Historical Development**:
- Emerged during Dutch colonial period
- Response to Sumatra's high humidity and constant rain
- Economic necessity—farmers needed fast cash flow
- Infrastructure limitations—no access to large wet mills
- Practical solution that created unique flavor

**Climate Necessity**:
- Sumatra has no reliable dry season
- Traditional sun-drying takes 2-4 weeks (impossible with frequent rain)
- Parchment coffee molds easily in high humidity
- Removing parchment allows faster drying
- Wet-hulling reduces total process time to 1-2 weeks

**Economic Drivers**:
- Smallholders need income quickly
- Cannot afford to hold coffee during long drying
- Village collectors purchase at parchment stage
- Risk transfer from farmer to collector/mill
- Faster turnover essential for farmer livelihood

### Wet-Hulling Step-by-Step Process

**Stage 1: Harvesting** (Varies by farm elevation)

- **Main harvest**: October-December (post-wet season)
- **Secondary harvest**: May-June (possible in some areas)
- **Method**: Hand-picking (terrain requires it)
- **Ripeness**: Variable (economic pressure to harvest quickly)
- **Cherry sorting**: Minimal at farm level
- **Transport**: To farmer's home for processing

**Stage 2: De-pulping** (Day 1, at farmer's small home mill)

- **Equipment**: Small hand-cranked or motorized pulper
- **Process**: Cherry skin and most pulp removed
- **Result**: Parchment coffee with mucilage attached
- **Timing**: Same day or next day after picking
- **By-product**: Pulp composted or fed to animals

**Stage 3: Overnight Fermentation** (12-24 hours, Day 1-2)

- **Method**: Beans in buckets or bags with mucilage attached
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours (not precisely controlled)
- **Purpose**: Loosen remaining mucilage
- **Environment**: Ambient temperature (warm, humid)
- **Monitoring**: Minimal—farmer experience-based
- **Variation**: Batch-to-batch inconsistency normal

**Stage 4: Washing** (Day 2)

- **Method**: Hand-washing in buckets or local stream
- **Goal**: Remove loosened mucilage
- **Water source**: Well, stream, or irrigation water
- **Agitation**: Manual stirring and rubbing
- **Cleanliness**: Variable (not controlled like commercial wet mill)
- **Result**: Clean parchment coffee (Gabah)

**Stage 5: Pre-Drying** (Day 2-4, at farmer's home)

This is where Giling Basah begins to differ from washed processing:

- **Location**: Tarp outside home, roof, or small raised bed
- **Duration**: 1-3 days only (very short)
- **Target moisture**: 40-50% (vs. 10-12% for fully dried parchment)
- **Conditions**: Whatever weather allows
- **Coverage**: If rain threatens, brought inside
- **Inconsistency**: Major variable in process
- **Goal**: Dry just enough to transport and hull

**Stage 6: Sale to Collector** (Day 3-5, KEY ECONOMIC STEP)

- **Form**: Semi-dried parchment coffee (Gabah)
- **Moisture**: 40-50% (still quite wet)
- **Location**: Village collector or local market
- **Payment**: Immediate cash to farmer
- **Price**: Based on weight and quality visual inspection
- **Farmer exit point**: Farmer's involvement ends here

**Stage 7: Wet-Hulling** (Day 4-6, at collector's facility, THE DEFINING STEP)

This is the "Giling Basah" (wet-hulling) step that gives the process its name and creates Mandheling's unique character:

- **Equipment**: Mechanical huller (removes parchment)
- **Bean moisture**: 40-50% (extremely high vs. normal 10-12%)
- **Process**: Parchment mechanically stripped off wet beans
- **Challenge**: High-moisture beans are soft, damage easily
- **Result**: Green coffee exposed at high moisture content
- **Appearance**: Beans are whitish-green, swollen, soft
- **Defects**: Physical damage common (broken beans, hull fragments)
- **Critical impact**: Exposed beans absorb environmental influences

**Why This Creates Unique Flavor**:
- **High moisture exposure**: Beans absorb humidity, environmental microbes
- **Enzymatic activity**: Different from dry parchment-protected beans
- **Physical damage**: Hulling wet beans causes surface damage
- **Oxidation**: Exposed beans oxidize differently
- **Microbial influence**: Environmental microbes affect flavor development
- **Chemical changes**: Lipid and acid profiles altered
- **Result**: Earthy, herbal, savory notes characteristic of Mandheling

**Stage 8: Final Drying** (Day 5-15, at collector or mill)

- **Form**: Green coffee (no parchment protection)
- **Initial moisture**: 40-50%
- **Target moisture**: 11-13% (slightly higher than washed coffees)
- **Location**: Larger tarps, concrete patios, or covered areas
- **Duration**: 5-12 days depending on weather
- **Method**: Sun drying when possible, covered during rain
- **Raking**: Regular turning to prevent mold
- **Challenge**: Exposed beans at high moisture are mold-prone
- **Color change**: Whitish-green → blue-green (characteristic Mandheling color)
- **Monitoring**: Visual and moisture meter testing

**Color Development During Drying**:
The distinctive blue-green color of Sumatra Mandheling develops during this stage:
- Wet-hulled beans start whitish-green
- Oxidation and drying create blue-green hue
- Different from bright green of washed coffees
- Color indicates proper wet-hull process
- Darker blue-green can indicate older crop

**Stage 9: Sorting & Grading** (At exporter's facility)

- **Screen sorting**: Separate by bean size (Grade 1 = large, uniform)
- **Density sorting**: Remove low-density beans (defects)
- **Hand sorting**: Multiple passes to remove defects
- **Grade 1 (TP - Triple Picked)**: Highest grade
  - Minimal defects (0-11 per 300g sample)
  - Large beans (screen 18+)
  - Uniform color
  - Three hand-sorting passes
- **Lower grades**: Grade 2, Grade 3 (more defects, smaller beans)

**Stage 10: Bagging & Export**

- **Form**: Green coffee (wet-hulled, dried, sorted)
- **Bagging**: 60 kg jute bags (export standard)
- **Marking**: Origin, grade, crop year
- **Storage**: Warehouse until shipment
- **Export**: Through Medan port (North Sumatra)
- **Destination**: Global specialty coffee market

**Pre-heat**: 400-425°F (204-218°C)

**Charge Temperature**: 370-390°F (188-199°C)
- Lower than dense washed beans (Mandheling less dense)

**Drying Phase** (0:00-6:30):
- **Target**: Gentle, even heat penetration
- **Rate of rise**: 15-20°F/min at midpoint
- **Turning point**: 160-180°F (71-82°C), 1:00-1:30
- **Yellow point**: 5:30-7:00
- **Goal**: Thorough drying, avoid scorching
- **Color**: Blue-green → yellow → tan
- **Aroma**: Hay, grain

**Browning/Maillard Phase** (6:30-10:00):
- **Target**: Flavor development, sugar caramelization
- **Rate of rise**: 10-15°F/min
- **Color development**: Tan → brown
- **Aroma**: Toasty, nutty → sweet
- **Heat management**: Steady heat application
- **Goal**: Develop complexity, avoid baking

**First Crack** (~10:00-11:00):
- **Onset temperature**: 380-390°F (193-199°C)
- **Duration**: 60-90 seconds
- **Energy**: Endothermic
- **Physical change**: Bean expansion
- **Monitoring**: Listen for crack progression

**Development Phase** (Post-Crack):
- **Target for medium-dark**: 90-120 seconds post-crack
- **Rate of rise**: 5-10°F/min
- **Color**: Medium-dark brown
- **Aroma**: Chocolate, spice, sweet
- **Goal**: Reach 2nd crack onset

**Second Crack** (~12:00-13:00):
- **Onset**: 425-430°F (218-221°C)
- **Duration**: 10-20 seconds into 2nd crack
- **Sound**: Lighter, faster snapping
- **Smoke**: Increases
- **Decision point**: Drop soon after onset for medium-dark

**Drop**: 430-440°F (221-227°C)
- **Total time**: 12:00-14:00 minutes
- **Development ratio**: 15-20%
- **Visual**: Medium-dark brown, slight oil beginning
- **Aroma check**: Chocolate, spice, no burnt notes

**Cooling**:
- Immediate, aggressive cooling
- Target <100°F within 4-5 minutes
- Air cooling (water misting acceptable but not necessary)

### Roasting Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Scorching (Common with Mandheling)**
- **Symptom**: Burnt, acrid flavors; tipping
- **Cause**: Too-fast heat, Mandheling's lower density
- **Solution**:
  - Lower charge temperature
  - Gentler heat during drying phase
  - Increase airflow
  - Watch rate of rise (don't exceed 20°F/min in drying)

**Challenge 2: Baking (Flat, Dull Flavor)**
- **Symptom**: Flat, one-dimensional, bready/baked
- **Cause**: Stalled temperature, insufficient heat
- **Solution**:
  - Higher charge temperature
  - More aggressive heat in Maillard phase
  - Avoid temperature plateaus
  - Shorter total roast time

**Challenge 3: Excessive Earthiness**
- **Symptom**: Overwhelming muddy/dirty earth flavor
- **Cause**: Under-development, light roast on earthy coffee
- **Solution**:
  - Extend development time
  - Roast darker (medium-dark minimum)
  - Ensure complete first crack
  - Into second crack for traditional profile

**Challenge 4: Loss of Origin Character**
- **Symptom**: Tastes generic, no Mandheling character
- **Cause**: Over-roasting, too dark
- **Solution**:
  - Drop earlier (before deep 2nd crack)
  - Medium-dark is optimal, not Italian dark
  - Monitor color and aroma
  - Cup test to find sweet spot

**Challenge 5: Inconsistency Batch-to-Batch**
- **Symptom**: Different flavors each roast
- **Cause**: Variable green coffee (nature of wet-hulling)
- **Solution**:
  - Source from reliable supplier
  - Grade 1 only (better consistency)
  - Establish baseline profile and adjust
  - Accept some variation (part of Mandheling character)

### Degassing & Rest Period

**Post-Roast Degassing**:
- **CO2 release**: Mandheling releases CO2 slower than washed coffees
- **Optimal rest**: 3-7 days post-roast
- **Medium roast**: 3-5 days rest
- **Dark roast**: 5-7 days rest
- **Espresso**: 7-10 days for best results
- **Filter brewing**: 3-5 days minimum

**Flavor Development During Rest**:
- First 24 hours: CO2-dominated, sharp
- Days 2-5: Flavors integrate, body develops
- Days 5-10: Peak flavor (most balanced)
- Days 10-21: Still excellent, gradual decline
- After 21 days: Noticeably fading

### Grinding Recommendations

**Grind Size Impact**:
- **Too fine**: Over-extraction, excessive bitterness, muddy
- **Too coarse**: Under-extraction, sour (though Mandheling rarely sour), weak
- **Just right**: Balanced extraction, chocolate sweetness, clean earth

**Grinder Recommendations**:
- **Burr grinder**: Essential (flat or conical)
- **Blade grinder**: Avoid (uneven particles)
- **Grind fresh**: Immediately before brewing

**Grind Size by Method**:
- **Espresso**: Fine (20-25 seconds extraction)
- **Moka Pot**: Fine-medium
- **AeroPress**: Medium-fine to medium
- **Pour-over**: Medium
- **Drip**: Medium
- **French Press**: Medium-coarse
- **Cold brew**: Coarse

## 📝 Summary & Final Assessment

**Indonesia Sumatra Mandheling Wet-Hulled** is coffee's most polarizing origin. It represents a completely different paradigm from the bright, clean, acidic coffees that dominate specialty coffee discourse. This is earthy, herbal, full-bodied coffee defined by a unique processing method born of necessity in Sumatra's challenging climate.

### Key Takeaways

**Processing Defines Everything**: The wet-hulling (Giling Basah) method creates Mandheling's character more than variety, terroir, or roasting. Understanding this process is essential to appreciating—or rejecting—this coffee.

**Polarizing Profile**: Coffee professionals either love Mandheling's earthy, herbal, syrupy character or dismiss it as defective. There is little middle ground. This coffee has its devoted following who wouldn't drink anything else, and its detractors who avoid it entirely.

**Full Body Champion**: Mandheling offers the heaviest, most syrupy body of any single-origin coffee. This is its greatest strength and primary appeal. French press Mandheling is a textural experience unmatched by washed coffees.

**Very Low Acidity**: Naturally the lowest-acid coffee available. Perfect for those seeking smooth, mellow coffee or those with acid sensitivity. The trade-off is lack of brightness that others prefer.

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Sumatra Mandheling Wet-Hulled earns four stars for being authentically, unapologetically itself. It doesn't try to be bright, clean, and acidic—it embraces earthy, heavy, and smooth.

**In three words**: Earthy. Syrupy. Unique.

**Recommended Purchase**: Yes, if you appreciate full-bodied, low-acid, earthy coffee. Try before buying a large quantity—this profile is polarizing. If you love it, you've found your coffee. If you don't, at least you've experienced one of coffee's most distinctive origins.
