# 🫘 Burundi Kayanza Bourbon Double-Washed

**Origin**: [[Origins/Burundi|Burundi]]  
**Region**: [[Origins/Burundi-Kayanza|Kayanza Province]]  
**Variety**: [[Coffee Varieties/Bourbon|Red Bourbon]]  
**Processing**: [[Processing Methods/Double-Washed|Double Fermentation Washed]]  
**Grade**: A1 (Burundi grading)  
**Altitude**: 1,700-2,000 MASL

## 📋 Overview

Burundi Kayanza Bourbon Double-Washed represents African coffee at its brightest and most complex—showcasing the traditional double-fermentation washing process that creates extraordinary clarity and vibrant fruit notes. Burundi shares Rwanda's post-conflict coffee transformation story, volcanic terroir, and Bourbon variety dominance, but adds its own distinctive processing tradition that creates even brighter, more citrus-forward profiles.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Double fermentation washed processing (traditional Burundian method)
- Kayanza Province terroir (northern Burundi, highest altitudes)
- Red Bourbon variety (same genetics as Rwanda, slightly different expression)
- Extreme brightness and clarity (double-wash creates exceptional clean cup)
- Cherry, citrus, and floral notes (signature Burundian profile)
- Very high altitude (1,700-2,000 MASL among highest in Burundi)
- Smallholder washing station model (similar to Rwanda)
- Post-conflict specialty coffee development (2000s transformation)

Burundi's coffee story parallels Rwanda's—decades of civil war and conflict (1993-2005), followed by deliberate specialty coffee development as economic reconstruction strategy. The country embraced its traditional double-fermentation washing process (longer and more complex than standard washing) as a quality differentiator, creating coffees of exceptional brightness and clarity.

**Double-Fermentation Processing**:
Unlike standard washed coffee (one fermentation stage), Burundian double-wash involves two separate fermentation periods with washing between. This extended, multi-stage process removes all mucilage completely, creates more complex acidity development, and produces extraordinarily clean cups with vibrant citrus and floral notes that distinguish Burundian coffee from even its close Rwandan neighbor.

**Terroir & Geography**:
Kayanza Province in northern Burundi borders Rwanda and shares similar volcanic soils, high altitudes (1,700-2,000 MASL), and cool temperatures. The region benefits from Lake Tanganyika's proximity (one of African Great Lakes), which moderates climate. Burundi's small size (similar to Rwanda) means concentrated coffee production in ideal high-altitude zones.

**Red Bourbon Dominance**:
Like Rwanda, Burundi is essentially a Bourbon monoculture (90%+ of production), introduced during Belgian colonial period (Burundi was part of Belgian Ruanda-Urundi, 1916-1962). Post-independence, Burundi continued Bourbon cultivation, and post-conflict specialty focus leveraged the variety's quality potential.

**Market Position**:
Burundian coffee offers exceptional African brightness at accessible specialty pricing ($16-24/12oz roasted). It's brighter than Rwandan coffee (double-wash effect), less intense than Kenyan, and represents outstanding value for those seeking vibrant acidity and fruit-forward profiles.

## 🌍 Origin & Geography: Kayanza Province

### Location & Topography

**Geographic Position**:
- **Country**: Burundi (East-Central Africa, landlocked)
- **Province**: Kayanza (northern Burundi)
- **Altitude**: 1,400-2,000 MASL (coffee typically 1,700-2,000 MASL)
- **Coordinates**: ~3°S, 29.6°E
- **Borders**: Rwanda to north, Lake Tanganyika to southwest
- **Size**: Burundi is tiny (27,830 km², similar to Maryland)

**Topography**:
- Steep mountainous terrain (coffee on hillsides)
- Volcanic soils from ancient activity
- Excellent drainage from slopes
- Hand-picking required (terrain prevents mechanization)

**Climate**:
- Tropical highland (modified by altitude)
- Bimodal rainfall (two wet, two dry seasons)
- Main harvest: March-June
- Cool temperatures (altitude effect)

## 🔄 Processing: Double-Fermentation Washed

### Stage 1: Harvest (March-June Main Season)

**Selective Hand-Picking**:
- Only fully ripe red cherries
- Multiple selective passes
- Small-scale delivery to washing stations

### Stage 2: Flotation & Sorting

**Water Flotation**:
- Floaters removed (defects, unripe)
- Sinkers proceed to processing

### Stage 3: Depulping

**Mechanical Depulping**:
- Skin and pulp removal
- Mucilage retained for fermentation

### Stage 4: First Fermentation (12-24 hours)

**Dry Fermentation**:
- Beans in tanks without added water
- Natural enzyme activity begins mucilage breakdown
- Temperature monitoring (18-22°C typical)
- Duration: 12-24 hours (altitude/temperature dependent)

### Stage 5: First Washing

**Intermediate Washing**:
- Partial mucilage removal
- First density grading
- Clean water rinse

### Stage 6: Second Fermentation (12-24 hours)

**Secondary Fermentation** (The "Double" in Double-Washed):
- Beans ferment again (additional 12-24 hours)
- Further mucilage breakdown
- More complex acid development
- Critical timing (over-fermentation risk)

**Why Second Fermentation Creates Brightness**:
- Extended fermentation develops more complex acids
- Complete mucilage removal (cleaner than single-wash)
- Acid spectrum development (citric, malic, tartaric acids)

### Stage 7: Final Washing

**Complete Mucilage Removal**:
- Washing channels
- Density grading (A1/A2/A3)
- Perfectly clean parchment

### Stage 8: Drying (14-21 days)

**Raised Bed Sun Drying**:
- African-style raised beds
- 2-3 cm layer thickness
- Constant raking and turning
- Target: 10-11% moisture

**Drying Timeline**:
- Week 1: Intensive turning (hourly)
- Week 2: Moderate turning
- Week 3: Final drying to target moisture

### Stage 9: Dry Milling & Sorting

**Grading**:
- Screen sorting (size)
- Density sorting (quality)
- Electronic color sorting
- Hand sorting (3-5 passes)
- **A1 Grade**: Highest quality (zero defects, highest density)
