## 📋 Overview

Brazil Sul de Minas Yellow Bourbon Natural represents the quintessential Brazilian coffee experience: smooth, sweet, full-bodied, low-acid, chocolate and nut-forward coffee that has made Brazil the world's largest coffee producer and shaped global coffee preferences for over 150 years. This coffee embodies everything that makes Brazilian coffee distinctive and beloved.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Yellow Bourbon variety (rare mutation, superior sweetness)
- Natural processing (traditional Brazilian method)
- Sul de Minas region (Brazil's premium coffee zone)
- Chocolate and nut-forward flavor profile
- Full body, creamy mouthfeel
- Low to medium acidity (smooth, approachable)
- Exceptional sweetness (caramel, brown sugar, honey)
- Perfect for espresso and milk-based drinks
- Outstanding value (quality-to-price ratio)

**Why This Coffee Matters**:

Brazil produces one-third of the world's coffee. Brazilian coffee defined the baseline flavor profile that most people associate with "coffee" - smooth, sweet, nutty, chocolatey, low acid. Sul de Minas (Southern Minas Gerais state) is Brazil's premier specialty coffee region, combining ideal altitude (900-1,300 MASL), traditional cultivation methods, and quality-focused producers.

Yellow Bourbon is a rare natural mutation of Red Bourbon where ripe cherries turn yellow instead of red. Beyond aesthetics, Yellow Bourbon consistently demonstrates superior sweetness, clarity, and cup quality compared to Red Bourbon and other Brazilian varieties. Its genetic makeup creates higher sugar development and more complex flavor profiles.

Natural processing - drying whole cherries with fruit intact - is Brazil's traditional method. The country's reliable dry season (May-September) and mechanization infrastructure make natural processing economically viable at scale while producing the sweet, fruity, full-bodied profile Brazilians perfected. Unlike wet processing that washes away fruit, natural processing infuses the bean with fruit sugars during the weeks-long drying process, creating characteristic Brazilian sweetness and body.

**Market Position**: Brazil Sul de Minas Yellow Bourbon Natural offers exceptional quality at accessible pricing ($14-20/12oz roasted). It's proof that excellent coffee doesn't require exotic origins or rare varieties - when terroir, variety, and processing align with centuries of expertise, the results are world-class.

**Cultural Significance**: Brazilian coffee is the foundation of global coffee trade. From Italian espresso to American diner coffee to Japanese kissaten culture, Brazilian beans have defined coffee flavor profiles worldwide. This coffee represents that heritage at its finest.

**Misconception Alert**: "Brazilian coffee is commodity, low-quality coffee." This stereotype comes from bulk commercial Brazilian coffee (low-altitude, poorly processed). Sul de Minas specialty coffee - especially Yellow Bourbon - demonstrates that Brazilian coffee can compete with any origin for quality when produced with care.

- **Anaerobic pockets**: Defects (off-flavors if oxygen excluded)
- **Raking purpose**: Oxygenate cherries, prevent anaerobic conditions
- **Indicators of good fermentation**: Sweet fruity aroma, even color
- **Indicators of bad fermentation**: Vinegar smell, black/moldy cherries, sour smell

**Weather Challenges**:
- **Rain**: Disaster if cherries rewetted (mold, fermentation defects, potential total loss)
- **Protection**: Tarps, mobile covers, greenhouses (high-end operations)
- **High humidity**: Slows drying (mold risk if prolonged)
- **Excessive heat**: Can "bake" cherries (create vegetal, hay-like defects)

**Brazilian Advantage**:
- Reliable dry season (May-September) with minimal rain risk
- Consistent sunshine (6-8 hours direct sun daily)
- Moderate humidity (40-60%) during drying season
- Predictable weather allows large-scale natural processing

**Stage 4: Hulling & Dry Milling** (Post-Drying, Pre-Export)

**Storage in Cherry** (Descanso - Resting):
- **Duration**: 30-60 days after drying
- **Purpose**: Moisture equalizes within cherry and bean
- **Storage**: Cool, dry warehouses (climate controlled)
- **Benefit**: More stable coffee, flavor development

**Hulling Process**:
- **Timing**: Shortly before export or roasting
- **Method**: Mechanical hullers remove dried fruit (cascara) and parchment
- **Result**: Green coffee bean exposed
- **Byproduct**: Cascara (dried fruit) used for tea or compost

**Grading & Sorting**:
1. **Screen sorting**: Separate by bean size
   - Brazil uses screen sizes 17/18 (large), 15/16 (medium), 13/14 (small)
   - Yellow Bourbon typically screen 15-17
2. **Gravity sorting**: Density tables remove low-density beans (defects, immature)
3. **Electronic color sorting**: Machines detect and remove discolored beans (defects)
4. **Hand sorting**: Final quality control (remove quakers, insect damage, visual defects)
   - Premium lots: Multiple hand-sort passes
   - Commercial lots: Minimal hand sorting

**Brazilian Grading System**:
- **NY 2**: <4 defects per 300g sample (premium specialty)
- **NY 2/3**: 4-8 defects per 300g (good specialty)
- **NY 3**: 9-23 defects (commercial specialty)
- **NY 4-8**: Lower grades (commodity)
- **Screen size**: Often listed with grade (e.g., "NY 2, Screen 17/18")

**Final Preparation**:
- **Bagging**: 60kg or 69kg bags (export standard)

- **Brazilian tradition**: Popular roast level in Brazil
- **Appeal**: Rich, intense, satisfying

**Dark Roast (French)** ⭐⭐⭐
- **Drop temperature**: 438-450°F (225-232°C)
- **Characteristics**: Roast flavors dominant, smoky, bittersweet
- **Origin character**: Mostly lost
- **Body**: Still present (Brazilian coffee handles dark roast well)
- **Use case**: If dark roast specifically required (not recommended for quality beans)

### Roast Profile Development

**Bean Density Considerations**:
- **Brazilian altitude**: 900-1,300 MASL = moderate density (not SHB hard)
- **Natural processing**: Slightly lower density than washed (absorbed oils, sugars)
- **Implication**: Roasts faster than high-altitude washed coffees
- **Heat penetration**: Moderate heat requirement

**Moisture Content**:
- **Natural processed**: Typically 10.5-11.5% moisture (slightly higher than washed)
- **Fresh crop**: May be 11-12% (adjust profile)
- **Aged coffee**: 10-10.5% (roasts faster)

**Suggested Profile** (Medium Roast - 12 lb batch):

**Pre-heat**: 400-425°F (204-218°C)

**Charge Temperature**: 380-400°F (193-204°C)
- Moderate charge (Brazilian beans not extremely dense)

**Drying Phase** (0:00-6:00):
- **Rate of rise**: 15-25°F/min at midpoint
- **Turning point**: 140-160°F (60-71°C), 0:45-1:15
- **Yellow point**: 5:00-6:30
- **Goal**: Even heat distribution
- **Aroma**: Grassy → hay → sweet grain

**Browning/Maillard Phase** (6:00-9:30):
- **Rate of rise**: 10-18°F/min
- **Heat application**: Moderate, steady
- **Color**: Tan → light brown → medium brown
- **Aroma**: Toasted grain → nuts → chocolate emerging
- **Critical**: Chocolate and nut flavor development (don't rush)

**First Crack** (~9:30-10:30):
- **Onset temperature**: 380-395°F (193-202°C)
- **Duration**: 60-90 seconds
- **Energy**: Endothermic (temperature plateau)
- **Monitoring**: Clear, strong crack (Brazilian naturals crack assertively)

**Development Phase**:
- **Target for medium roast**: 75-105 seconds post-crack
- **Rate of rise**: 4-8°F/min (declining)
- **Color**: Medium brown
- **Aroma**: Chocolate, caramel, sweet
- **Goal**: Develop sweetness and body

**Drop**: 418-428°F (214-220°C)
- **Total time**: 11:00-13:30 minutes
- **Development ratio**: 15-18%
- **Visual**: Medium brown, no surface oil
- **Aroma**: Sweet, chocolatey, nutty

**For Medium-Dark (Vienna)**:
- **Extended development**: 105-120+ seconds post-crack
- **Enter second crack**: 10-15 seconds (light crackling)
- **Drop**: 428-438°F (220-225°C)
- **Visual**: Dark brown, slight oil sheen emerging
- **Total time**: 12:00-14:30 minutes

**Cooling**:
- **Immediate**: Aggressive air cooling
- **Target**: <100°F within 4-5 minutes
- **Method**: Maximum airflow, stirring

### Roasting Tips & Challenges

**Challenge 1: Flat Profile (Baking)**
- **Symptom**: Cardboard, peanutty, lack of sweetness
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat during browning
- **Solution**: Higher heat in Maillard phase, shorter total time

**Challenge 2: Underdevelopment**
- **Symptom**: Grassy, sour, astringent
- **Cause**: Too-short development time
- **Solution**: Extend post-crack development 15-30 seconds

**Challenge 3: Natural Processing Defects Amplified**
- **Symptom**: Fermented, overripe, musty flavors
- **Cause**: Defects in green coffee
- **Solution**: Source quality beans, strict green sorting pre-roast

**Challenge 4: Excessive Roast Flavor**
- **Symptom**: Generic roasted flavor, origin character lost
- **Cause**: Too-dark roast, too-fast development
- **Solution**: Pull roast earlier, slower development

**Strength: Forgiving Variety**
- Brazilian naturals are relatively forgiving compared to delicate varieties
- Wide roast window (medium to medium-dark all work well)
- Consistent from batch to batch
- Good choice for learning roasting
