## 📋 Overview

Mexico Chiapas Bourbon Organic Washed represents traditional Mexican coffee at its finest. Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state bordering Guatemala, produces the country's highest-quality specialty coffee. Traditional Bourbon variety, organic certification, and washed processing create a classic, balanced, approachable cup.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Chiapas origin**: Mexico's premier coffee region
- **Bourbon variety**: Traditional quality variety
- **Organic certification**: Mexico is major organic coffee producer
- **Washed processing**: Clean, balanced, traditional
- **Chocolate-nutty flavor**: Classic Central American profile
- **Medium body**: Smooth, balanced mouthfeel
- **Medium acidity**: Balanced, not overly bright
- **Altura grade**: High-altitude designation
- **Fair Trade common**: Cooperative production
- **Excellent value**: Quality at accessible pricing

Chiapas shares borders and terroir similarities with Guatemala's renowned coffee regions. The mountainous terrain, volcanic-influenced soils, shade-grown tradition, and indigenous coffee-growing culture create ideal conditions for high-quality coffee. Mexico's proximity to the US makes it an accessible specialty origin with strong organic and Fair Trade movements.

**Historical Significance**: Coffee came to Mexico in the late 1700s, with Chiapas becoming a major producer by the 1800s. Indigenous communities and small farmers have maintained traditional cultivation practices. The organic coffee movement found strong adoption in Chiapas in the 1990s-2000s, with Mexico becoming one of the world's largest organic coffee exporters.

**Misconception Alert**: Mexican coffee is often overlooked in favor of Central American neighbors (Guatemala, Honduras). However, Chiapas Altura coffee rivals Guatemalan and Honduran quality while offering excellent value. This is high-quality specialty coffee, not commodity Mexican coffee.
