## 📋 Overview

Tanzania Kilimanjaro Peaberry Washed represents a unique combination of exceptional terroir and rare bean morphology. Grown on the slopes of Africa's highest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro, this coffee features "peaberry" beans—a natural mutation where the coffee cherry produces a single, round bean instead of the typical two flat-sided beans.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Peaberry beans**: Single round bean (5-8% of harvest)
- **Mount Kilimanjaro terroir**: Volcanic soil, high altitude (1,400-2,000 MASL)
- **African heirloom varieties**: Bourbon, Kent, Typica genetics
- **Washed processing**: Clean, bright, complex profile
- **Winey, berry-forward flavor**: Blackcurrant, red wine, citrus
- **High acidity**: Bright, structured, wine-like
- **Medium body**: Elegant mouthfeel
- **Peaberry premium pricing**: 20-30% higher than regular beans
- **Specialty market favorite**: Unique, sought-after
- **Tanzania coffee heritage**: Kilimanjaro is Tanzania's premier coffee region

Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m/19,341 ft), Africa's tallest peak, creates a unique coffee terroir. The volcanic slopes, altitude, climate, and rich soils produce coffee of exceptional brightness and complexity. When combined with the concentrated flavor intensity of peaberry beans, the result is one of Africa's most distinctive coffees.

**Historical Significance**: Coffee was introduced to Tanzania (then German East Africa, later Tanganyika) in the late 1800s by missionaries. Mount Kilimanjaro became the premier growing region. Tanzania's coffee industry was nationalized post-independence (1960s-1980s), leading to quality decline. Liberalization in the 1990s and specialty coffee movement have revitalized Tanzanian coffee, with Kilimanjaro leading the renaissance.

**Misconception Alert**: Many believe peaberry is a variety or that all peaberries taste better. Reality: Peaberry is a bean mutation (not variety), occurring in all varieties. The alleged superior flavor is debated—some claim concentrated flavor from single-bean development, others say it's selection bias (only best lots are sorted as peaberry). What's certain: peaberry beans roast more evenly due to round shape, justifying some price premium.

## 🌱 Variety Information & Peaberry Phenomenon

### African Heirloom Varieties in Tanzania

Tanzania Kilimanjaro coffee is typically a mix of African heirloom varieties:

**Primary Varieties**:

1. **Bourbon** (Most common)
   - French Mission Bourbon introduction (late 1800s)
   - Excellent cup quality
   - Moderate yield
   - Genetic base for Tanzania coffee

2. **Kent** (Significant presence)
   - Selected in India (1920s) from Typica
   - Better disease resistance than Typica/Bourbon
   - Good cup quality
   - Adapted to Tanzanian conditions

3. **Typica** (Less common now)
   - Original introduction variety
   - Tall, low-yielding
   - Excellent quality but economically challenging
   - Being replaced by more productive varieties

**Modern Varieties** (Increasing):
- **N39** (Bourbon selection): Tanzanian selection, good quality
- **KP423**: Kenyan variety, rust-resistant
- **Catimor types**: Rust resistance but lower cup quality (avoided in specialty)

### Peaberry: The Special Bean

**What Is Peaberry?**

**Normal Coffee Cherry**:
- Contains two flat-sided beans facing each other
- Each bean has one flat side, one curved side
- 92-95% of cherries produce normal beans
- Graded and sold as regular coffee

**Peaberry Cherry**:
- Contains ONE round bean instead of two flat beans
- Bean is completely round (both sides curved)
- 5-8% of cherries are peaberries (varies by variety, conditions)
- Requires sorting to separate from normal beans

**Why Peaberry Occurs**:
- **Natural mutation**: One ovule fails to develop, other ovule grows round
- **Genetic factors**: Some varieties have higher peaberry frequency
- **Environmental stress**: Stress may increase peaberry occurrence
- **Random**: Not fully understood, occurs naturally in all varieties

**Peaberry Characteristics**:
- **Shape**: Completely round, oval
- **Size**: Similar weight to single normal bean (half of two-bean pair)
- **Density**: Often perceived as denser (debated)
- **Screen size**: Slightly smaller than normal beans (round shape)
- **Appearance**: Distinctive round shape, easily identified

### Peaberry Flavor Profile—Myth vs. Reality

**Claims About Peaberry**:
- **Proponents claim**: Concentrated flavor, better quality, sweeter, brighter
- **Skeptics claim**: No inherent difference, marketing, selection bias

**Scientific Perspective**:
- **Flavor concentration**: Theoretically, single bean gets all the cherry's nutrients (vs. sharing with second bean). However, this is speculative—limited scientific evidence.
- **Roasting advantage**: CONFIRMED—Round shape roasts more evenly than flat beans (no thin edges to scorch or thick centers to under-develop). This IS a legitimate quality factor.
- **Grading selection**: Peaberry sorting is labor-intensive and expensive, so only high-quality lots are sorted. This creates selection bias—peaberry lots are often from better farms/cherries to begin with.

**Reality Check**:
Peaberry is NOT automatically superior, but:
1. Even roasting (round shape) is genuine advantage
2. Sorting process means quality coffee to start with
3. Concentrated flavor is plausible but not scientifically proven
4. Market perception creates demand, justifying price premium
5. Uniqueness and rarity add value regardless of cup quality

**Peaberry from Kilimanjaro**:
Tanzania Kilimanjaro Peaberry has strong market reputation for:
- Brightness and acidity (Kilimanjaro terroir)
- Berry and winey notes (East African characteristic)
- Clean, complex cup (washed processing)
- Even roast development (peaberry shape)
- Consistent quality (cooperative quality control)
