## 📋 Overview

Ecuador Loja Sidra Washed represents specialty coffee's cutting edge: a rare, exotic variety producing tropical fruit and floral complexity that rivals the world's finest coffees. Sidra, a variety of mysterious origins that gained recognition through Ecuadorian cultivation, has become one of specialty coffee's most sought-after and expensive varieties.

**Key Characteristics**:

Loja, Ecuador's southernmost highland region bordering Peru, produces coffee at extreme altitudes (1,500-2,000+ MASL). The cool temperatures, distinct microclimate, and traditional cultivation create perfect conditions for exotic varieties like Sidra. Ecuador's equatorial location and diverse microclimates make it an ideal laboratory for unique coffee varieties.

**Historical Significance**: Sidra's origins are mysterious—possibly Ethiopian heirloom brought to Ecuador via Réunion Island, or a natural mutation in Ecuador. It gained recognition in the 2000s-2010s through Ecuadorian competition success. The variety's explosive fruit and floral character made it an instant specialty favorite, commanding premium prices and sparking cultivation interest across origins.

**Misconception Alert**: Rare and expensive doesn't always mean better. However, Sidra's cup quality genuinely justifies its reputation—the tropical fruit and floral complexity is exceptional and distinctive. This isn't marketing hype; it's a legitimately unique and outstanding variety when well-cultivated and processed.

## 🌱 Variety: Sidra

### Origins & Mystery

**Sidra's Mysterious Background**:
- **Origin theories**:
  - Ethiopian heirloom via Réunion Island

- **Name**: "Sidra" origin unclear (possibly "cider" in Spanish?)
- **Discovery**: Recognized in Ecuador 2000s-2010s

- **Recognition**: Competition success revealed quality

**Why Origin Uncertainty**:
- Coffee brought to Ecuador over centuries from multiple sources
- Farm selections and natural mutations created local diversity
- Genetic studies ongoing (complex Arabica genetics)
- Sidra may be rediscovery of old variety or true novelty

### Characteristics

- **Shape**: Elongated, elegant
- **Density**: Very high at altitude
- **Appearance**: Standard green bean appearance

**Yield**:
