## 📋 Overview

Nicaragua Jinotega Maracaturra Natural combines three specialty elements: a premium origin (Jinotega), a unique large-bean variety (Maracaturra), and natural processing for fruit-forward complexity. This coffee represents Nicaragua's growing specialty coffee reputation and the exciting potential of hybrid varieties.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Maracaturra variety**: Hybrid of Maragogype (elephant bean) × Caturra
- **Large bean size**: Screen 18-20+ (elephant bean genetics)
- **Natural processing**: Fruit-forward, sweet, complex fermentation
- **Stone fruit dominant**: Peach, apricot, plum, nectarine
- **Tropical fruit**: Mango, papaya, passion fruit notes
- **Floral complexity**: Jasmine, orange blossom aromatics
- **Medium-full body**: Syrupy from natural processing
- **Sweet and approachable**: High sweetness, moderate acidity
- **Jinotega terroir**: Mountain coffee region, volcanic soils
- **Specialty market favorite**: Unique, sought-after profile

Jinotega, in Nicaragua's north-central highlands, is the country's premier coffee region. Known as "La Capital del Café" (The Coffee Capital), Jinotega produces coffee at altitudes from 1,200-1,600+ MASL with ideal mountain climate and volcanic soils. Combined with Maracaturra's large beans and natural processing, this creates one of Nicaragua's most distinctive specialty coffees.

**Historical Significance**: Nicaragua's coffee industry has faced challenges (political upheaval, hurricanes, economic issues) but has emerged as a quality-focused origin. Jinotega has led this transformation, with farms and cooperatives investing in variety selection and processing innovation. Maracaturra, developed in Nicaragua in the 1990s, represents this commitment to quality and uniqueness.

**Misconception Alert**: Large bean size (elephant bean genetics) doesn't automatically mean better quality—bean size and cup quality aren't directly correlated. However, Maracaturra's specific genetics (Maragogype × Caturra) combine large bean with good cup quality. Natural processing adds complexity and fruit-forward character that showcases the variety's potential.

## 🌱 Variety: Maracaturra

### Origins & Development

**Maracaturra Creation**:
- **Parents**: Maragogype × Caturra
- **Development**: Nicaragua, 1990s
- **Goal**: Combine Maragogype's large bean with Caturra's productivity and quality
- **Result**: Large bean (screen 18-20+), good cup quality, unique character

**Parent Varieties**:

**Maragogype** ("Elephant Bean"):
- Natural mutation of Typica (discovered Brazil, 1870s)
- Extremely large beans (30-40% larger than normal)
- Low yield (very large beans = fewer per tree)
- Mild, unique cup character
- Novelty and specialty market interest

**Caturra**:
- Bourbon dwarf mutation (Brazil, 1930s)
- Compact growth, higher productivity
- Excellent cup quality
- Widely planted across Latin America

**Maracaturra Hybrid**:
- Large bean size from Maragogype (screen 18-20+ typical)
- Better productivity than pure Maragogype
- Good cup quality from both parents
- Compact growth from Caturra influence
- Unique market positioning (large bean specialty)

### Maracaturra Characteristics

**Tree Morphology**:
- **Height**: 2-3 meters (more compact than Maragogype)
- **Shape**: Conical, relatively compact
- **Branching**: Moderate angle
- **Leaves**: Large (Maragogype influence)
- **Management**: Easier than Maragogype, manageable for smallholders

**Cherry & Bean**:
- **Cherry size**: Very large (Maragogype genetics)
- **Cherry color**: Red when ripe
- **Bean size**: Screen 18-20+ (very large)
- **Bean shape**: Elongated, large (elephant bean characteristic)
- **Density**: Good at altitude despite large size
- **Appearance**: Visually impressive (novelty factor)

**Yield**:
- **Productivity**: Lower than Caturra, higher than Maragogype
- **Challenge**: Large beans = fewer per cherry = lower total weight
- **Economics**: Requires premium pricing to justify cultivation
- **Specialty market**: Large bean and quality justifies price

**Disease Resistance**:
- **Coffee Leaf Rust**: Susceptible (both parents susceptible)
- **Management**: Requires good agricultural practices
- **Shade and nutrition**: Essential for health

### Maracaturra Cup Quality

**Flavor Potential**:
- Stone fruit character (peach, apricot, plum)
- Floral complexity (jasmine, orange blossom)
- Sweet, approachable cup
- Medium body, good mouthfeel
- Moderate acidity (balanced)
- Clean cup when well-processed

**Natural Processing Enhancement**:
- Natural process amplifies fruit notes
- Tropical fruit complexity emerges
- Sweetness increases dramatically
- Body becomes fuller, syrupy
- Fermentation adds complexity
- Result: Fruit-forward, sweet, complex cup

**Why Maracaturra + Natural Processing Works**:
1. Large beans provide more surface area for fruit contact during drying
2. Variety's inherent stone fruit character enhanced by natural process
3. Sweet, approachable variety becomes sweeter with natural processing
4. Large bean creates market interest and justifies premium
5. Natural processing adds uniqueness and complexity

## 🔄 Processing: Natural/Dry Process

### Harvest

**Selective Picking**:
- **Passes**: 3-5 rounds through farm
- **Ripeness**: Only fully ripe cherries (critical for natural)
- **Large cherries**: Maracaturra's large size makes ripe selection easier
- **Quality focus**: Natural processing magnifies input quality

### Natural Processing Method

**Day 1: Reception & Sorting**

- **Floatation**: Separate ripe from underripe/defects
- **Visual sorting**: Remove defects, unripe cherries
- **Quality critical**: Natural processing requires perfect cherries
- **Maracaturra challenge**: Large beans require more sorting attention

**Day 1-21: Sun Drying** (THE DEFINING STAGE)

**Drying Setup**:
- **Surface**: Raised drying beds (African beds) or patios
- **Layer thickness**: Thin (2-3 cm) for even drying
- **Large beans**: Maracaturra's size requires careful layering
- **Location**: Full sun exposure

**Drying Process**:
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks (21-28 days typical)
- **Turning**: Multiple times per day (every 1-2 hours during sun)
- **Coverage**: Covered at night, if rain threatens
- **Temperature**: Ambient sun drying
- **Humidity control**: Dry season (November-April) essential

**Fermentation During Drying**:
- **Internal fermentation**: Controlled fermentation inside cherry
- **Flavor development**: Enzymes and microbes create fruit complexity
- **Sugar absorption**: Cherry sugars absorbed by bean
- **Monitoring**: Visual, aroma, feel checks
- **Risk management**: Avoid over-fermentation (mold, off-flavors)

**Color Changes**: Cherry darkens from red to dark brown/black

**Stages**:
- **Days 1-7**: Cherry intact, fermentation begins
- **Days 8-14**: Cherry dries, fermentation peak
- **Days 15-21**: Final drying, fermentation slows
- **Days 21-28**: Target moisture reached (10-12%)

**Target Moisture**: 10-12% (entire dried cherry)

**Hulling** (After drying):
- **Timing**: After rest period (2-4 weeks post-drying)
- **Process**: Mechanical hulling removes dried cherry skin + parchment
- **Result**: Green coffee (natural processed)
- **Appearance**: Irregular color (natural process characteristic)

**Sorting & Grading**:
- **Screen sorting**: Size (18-20+ for Maracaturra)
- **Density sorting**: Remove low-density beans
- **Hand sorting**: Multiple passes for defect removal
- **Natural challenges**: Irregular color (not defect), quakers, fermentation defects
- **Labor intensive**: Natural processing requires intensive sorting
