## 📋 Overview

Peru Cajamarca Caturra Organic Washed represents the modern success story of Peruvian specialty coffee. Peru has emerged as a major specialty coffee origin over the past 20 years, transitioning from bulk commodity producer to one of the world's largest organic coffee exporters. Cajamarca region in northern Peru produces exceptional high-altitude coffees with clean, balanced profiles.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Organic certification (Peru is world's #1 organic coffee exporter)
- Fair Trade and Direct Trade programs common
- Caturra variety (compact, high-quality mutation of Bourbon)
- Traditional washed processing for clarity
- Milk chocolate and citrus flavor profile
- Medium body with bright, clean acidity
- Excellent balance and drinkability
- Smallholder cooperative production model
- Sustainable agriculture and forest conservation
- Exceptional value for quality (accessible pricing)

Cajamarca, located in Peru's northern highlands near the Ecuadorian border, produces coffee at elevations from 1,400-1,900+ MASL. The region's combination of altitude, climate, volcanic-influenced soils, and traditional cultivation practices creates coffees of exceptional quality and consistency.

**Historical Significance**: Peru's coffee industry was revolutionized in the 1990s-2000s by the organic and Fair Trade movements. Previously producing low-grade commodity coffee, Peruvian farmers—often organized in cooperatives—embraced organic certification and quality improvement. Today, Peru exports more organic coffee than any other country, and Cajamarca is at the heart of this transformation.

**Misconception Alert**: Some perceive Peruvian coffee as "basic" or commodity-grade due to its history and affordable pricing. Modern Peruvian specialty coffee, especially from high-altitude regions like Cajamarca, rivals Central American quality while remaining more accessible in price. This is exceptional value, not low quality.

## 🔄 Processing: Washed Method in Cajamarca

### Harvest Season & Timing

**Harvest Calendar**:
- **Main season**: May-September
- **Peak**: June-August
- **Duration**: 3-5 months
- **Passes**: 3-5 selective picking rounds
- **Interval**: 10-15 days between passes

**Ripeness Selection**:
- **Target**: Fully ripe cherries only
- **Brix**: 18-22° at optimal ripeness
- **Visual**: Deep red, uniform color
- **Training**: Cooperatives train pickers in selective harvesting
- **Quality control**: Pickers paid premium for ripe cherry only

**Cooperative Collection**:
- **Delivery**: Same-day or next-day to cooperative wet mill
- **Initial sorting**: Visual inspection, floatation
- **Weighing**: Payment based on ripe cherry weight
- **Traceability**: Lot tracking for quality feedback

### Washed Processing Step-by-Step

**Stage 1: Reception & Sorting** (Day 1)

- **Delivery**: Farmers bring cherries to cooperative wet mill
- **Visual inspection**: Staff check ripeness, reject defects
- **Flotation tank**: Cherries in water, floaters removed
- **Sorting effectiveness**: 2-5% removed (unripe, defects)
- **Quality commitment**: Cooperatives enforce standards

**Stage 2: Depulping** (Day 1, same day as harvest)

- **Equipment**: Mechanical disc depulpers
- **Process**: Skin and most pulp removed, parchment and mucilage remain
- **Adjustment**: Settings to avoid bean damage
- **Quality**: Unripe cherries don't depulp cleanly (easy to sort)
- **Pulp management**: Composted for organic fertilizer (circular system)

**Stage 3: Fermentation** (12-24 hours, Day 1-2)

**Method in Cajamarca**:
- **Dry fermentation**: Beans in tanks without water (common)
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours depending on temperature
- **Temperature**: 16-22°C (cooler at altitude = longer fermentation)
- **Monitoring**: Experienced mill operators test mucilage breakdown
- **Goal**: Complete mucilage removal, clean acidity development

**Fermentation Science**:
- Natural enzymes and microbes break down pectin/mucilage
- Controlled fermentation enhances acidity and clarity
- Under-fermentation: Residual mucilage, processing defects
- Over-fermentation: Vinegar, sour, fermented off-flavors
- Optimal: Clean breakdown, bright acidity, sweet cup

**Stage 4: Washing** (Day 2)

- **Channels**: Running water washing channels
- **Agitation**: Beans agitated to remove fermented mucilage
- **Multiple rinses**: 2-3 rinse cycles
- **Density sorting**: Floaters removed (lower quality)
- **Water management**: Recycling systems in modern cooperatives
- **Result**: Clean parchment coffee

**Stage 5: Drying** (7-15 days, Day 2-17)

**Drying Methods in Cajamarca**:

**Sun Drying** (Primary Method):
- **Surface**: Raised beds (African beds) or patios
- **Layer thickness**: 2-3 cm for even drying
- **Raking**: Every 1-2 hours during sun exposure
- **Coverage**: Protected at night and during any rain
- **Duration**: 10-15 days to 10-12% moisture
- **Dry season advantage**: May-September is dry (reliable drying)

**Mechanical Drying** (Supplemental):
- **Equipment**: Guardiola dryers (some cooperatives)
- **Use**: Finish drying after sun pre-dry, or backup if weather threatens
- **Temperature**: Controlled 40-45°C max
- **Advantage**: Quality control, weather independence

**Greenhouse Drying** (Growing Adoption):
- **Structure**: Clear plastic greenhouse over raised beds
- **Benefit**: Rain protection while allowing air circulation
- **Cost-effective**: Lower cost than mechanical
- **Quality**: Maintains sun-drying quality benefits

**Target Moisture**: 10-12% (optimal for storage and export)

**Stage 6: Storage** (Parchment Coffee)

- **Form**: Parchment coffee (protective layer retained)
- **Storage**: Cooperative warehouses, climate-controlled
- **Duration**: Weeks to months before hulling
- **Conditioning**: Moisture equalizes within beans
- **Traceability**: Lots tracked by farmer/region/date

### Dry Milling & Export Preparation

**Hulling**:
- **Timing**: Before export or sale to exporter
- **Process**: Parchment mechanically removed
- **Equipment**: Huller machines
