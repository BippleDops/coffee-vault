## 📋 Overview

India Malabar Monsooned AA represents one of coffee's most unique processing methods. "Monsooning" exposes coffee to monsoon winds and moisture, dramatically transforming flavor, body, and appearance. This creates a mellow, low-acid, heavy-bodied coffee unlike any other origin or process.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Monsooned process**: Unique to India, intentional moisture exposure
- **Very low acidity**: Lowest-acid coffee available
- **Heavy, syrupy body**: Extremely full-bodied mouthfeel
- **Mellow flavor**: Smooth, gentle, aged character
- **Spice notes**: Cardamom, pepper, exotic spices (Indian terroir)
- **Earthy, woody**: Cedar, tobacco, leather notes
- **Pale appearance**: Beans turn pale yellow/tan from monsooning
- **Swollen beans**: Moisture exposure enlarges beans (AA grade)
- **Historical process**: Developed accidentally in colonial era
- **Specialty niche**: Unique market (low-acid seekers, espresso blending)

The Malabar Coast of southwestern India has produced coffee since the 1600s. Monsooning developed in the 1800s during the age of sail—coffee shipped from India to Europe in wooden hulls was exposed to monsoon moisture during the long voyage, arriving transformed. Europeans grew to prefer this "aged" character, so Indian producers began intentionally monsooning coffee.

**Historical Significance**: India's monsooned coffee is one of the few examples of a processing "defect" (moisture exposure) becoming intentional and valued. Like civet coffee or aged coffee, monsooning transforms what would normally ruin coffee into a unique, sought-after product. This process exists nowhere else in the world at commercial scale.

**Misconception Alert**: Monsooned coffee's pale color, swollen beans, and mellow flavor might seem like defects to those unfamiliar with the process. This is intentional, traditional, and creates a specific cup profile valued for low acidity and heavy body. Evaluate on its own terms, not as failed washed coffee.

## 🌱 Variety: Mixed (Kent, SLN-795, others)

**Indian Arabica Varieties**:

**Kent**:
- Typica selection, discovered in India (1920s)
- Better rust resistance than Typica
- Good cup quality
- Widely planted in India

**SLN-795** (Selection 795):

## 🔄 Processing: Monsooning

### Historical Development

**Accidental Discovery** (1800s):
- Coffee shipped from India to Europe in wooden sailing ships
- Voyage: 6 months around Africa (pre-Suez Canal)
- Monsoon season exposure during voyage
- Moisture from sea air and monsoon winds penetrated coffee
- Result: Beans transformed—pale color, swollen, mellow flavor
- European market: Preferred this "aged" character
- Solution: Intentionally monsoon coffee in India before export

**Modern Monsooning** (1850s-present):
- Intentional process developed
- Warehouses on Malabar Coast
- Controlled exposure to monsoon winds
- Traditional method preserved to this day

### Monsooning Process Step-by-Step

**Stage 1: Base Coffee Preparation**

- **Harvest**: Standard selective picking
- **Initial processing**: Washed or dry-processed first
- **Hulling**: Parchment removed (green coffee)
- **Base quality**: AA grade (large beans) selected
- **Timing**: Ready for monsooning

**Stage 2: Monsooning Exposure** (June-September, 12-16 weeks)

**Warehouse Preparation**:
- **Location**: Open-sided warehouses on coast
- **Construction**: Designed for airflow
- **Timing**: Monsoon season (June-September)
- **Duration**: 12-16 weeks of exposure

**Exposure Process**:
- **Spreading**: Coffee spread 15-20 cm thick on concrete floors
- **Exposure**: Open sides allow monsoon winds to blow through
- **Moisture absorption**: Beans absorb moisture from humid monsoon air
- **Raking**: Coffee raked and turned every 2-3 days
- **Re-bagging**: Coffee moved to jute bags periodically
- **Re-spreading**: Cycled between spreading and bagging
- **Monitoring**: Experienced workers monitor transformation

**Physical Changes**:
- **Moisture**: Beans absorb moisture (12% → 16-18%)
- **Swelling**: Beans expand in size (moisture absorption)
- **Color**: Beans turn from green to pale yellow/tan
- **Texture**: Beans become softer, less brittle
- **Aroma**: Develops characteristic aged, mellow aroma

**Chemical Changes**:
- **Acid reduction**: Chlorogenic acids degrade (very low acidity result)
- **Flavor transformation**: Enzymatic and chemical changes
- **Body development**: Lipid and protein changes create heavy body
- **Mellow character**: Harsh notes softened

**Stage 3: Post-Monsoon Processing**

- **Re-drying**: Coffee dried back to 12-13% moisture (stable for storage)
- **Resting**: Allowed to rest and stabilize
- **Sorting**: Re-sorted for uniformity and defects
- **Grading**: AA grade (large, swollen beans)
- **Bagging**: Export-ready
- **Appearance check**: Uniform pale yellow/tan color
