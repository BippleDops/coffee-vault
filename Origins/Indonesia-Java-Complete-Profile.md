## 📋 Overview

Java Island is coffee's first colonial expansion - where Dutch planted coffee outside Arabia/Ethiopia (1696), giving global coffee the name "java" as synonym for coffee itself. Today Java produces balanced, estate-controlled coffee combining wet-hulling's Indonesian character with washed processing's cleanliness, representing Indonesian coffee's quality potential through heritage estate structure.

**Historical Significance**:
- **1696**: Coffee introduced to Java by Dutch (first outside origin regions)
- **"Java" = Coffee**: Word "java" became slang for coffee (English language)
- **Mocha-Java Blend**: Original coffee blend (Yemen Mocha + Java, 1700s-1800s)
- **Colonial Legacy**: Large Dutch estates established, some still operating
- **Leaf Rust** (1876-1900): Destroyed Java's Arabica, replanted Robusta
- **Arabica Return** (1920s+): Estates slowly reintroduced Arabica
- **Today**: Mix of heritage estates and smallholder, Robusta still dominant
