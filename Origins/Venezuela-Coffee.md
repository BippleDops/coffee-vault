## 📋 Overview

Venezuela once produced exceptional specialty coffee from Andean highlands - balanced, sweet, chocolate-forward profiles that rivaled Colombian neighbors. Political and economic crisis since 2000s devastated the industry (90%+ production decline), though specialty micro-lots occasionally emerge showing what Venezuelan coffee was and could be again.

**Historical Significance**:
- **Peak 1970s-1990s**: 1-2 million bags annually, quality reputation
- **Andean Coffee**: High-altitude (1,000-1,800 MASL) quality production
- **Traditional Varieties**: Bourbon, Typica quality genetics
- **Táchira Region**: Famous for exceptional quality (border with Colombia)
- **Specialty Potential**: Demonstrated competition-level quality

**Crisis Impact (2000s-Present)**:
- **Economic Collapse**: Hyperinflation, currency crisis
- **Political Instability**: Governance challenges
- **Infrastructure Decay**: Processing facilities deteriorated
- **Migration**: Coffee farmers leaving for Colombia, other countries
- **Production Collapse**: 90%+ decline from peak
- **Market Loss**: Minimal international specialty presence

**Current Situation**:
- **Tiny Production**: 50,000-100,000 bags estimate (uncertain data)
- **Occasional Micro-Lots**: Some specialty coffee still emerges
- **Quality Potential**: Terroir and knowledge remain (if stability returns)
- **Future Uncertain**: Recovery depends on political/economic stabilization
