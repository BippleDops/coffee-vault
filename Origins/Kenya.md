## 📍 Geography & Climate

### Location

Kenya sits on the equator in East Africa, bordered by Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Sudan. Mount Kenya (second highest in Africa at 5,199m) dominates the landscape, and its volcanic slopes provide ideal coffee-growing conditions.

### Growing Conditions

**Altitude Range**: 1,400 - 2,100 meters above sea level (MASL)
- Sweet spot: 1,600-2,100 MASL (premium quality)
- High altitude + equatorial = slow maturation, complex flavors
- Cool nights, warm days = intense flavor development

**Climate**:
- **Temperature**: 13-26°C (55-79°F) in growing zones
- **Rainfall**: 1,000-2,000mm annually, bimodal pattern
- **Long Rains**: March-May
- **Short Rains**: October-December
- **Dry Seasons**: January-February, June-September

**Soil**:
- Rich volcanic soil (Mount Kenya, Aberdare Range)
- High phosphoric acid content (contributes to acidity)
- Deep red laterite
- Excellent drainage

## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Kenyan Washed Processing (Unique Double Fermentation)

**Kenya's Signature Process**:

1. **Cherry Picking**: Only ripe cherries, selective harvesting
2. **Pulping**: Within 24 hours, remove fruit
3. **First Fermentation**: 24-36 hours in tanks (dry fermentation)
4. **Washing**: Remove mucilage with channels (water flow)
5. **Second Fermentation**: 12-24 hours in clean water (wet fermentation)
6. **Final Wash**: Thorough washing in channels
7. **Drying**: 10-20 days on raised beds (African beds)

**Why Double Fermentation?**:
