## 📍 Geography & Climate

### Location
Colombia is located in northwest South America, bordered by Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama. The country is uniquely positioned with both Pacific and Caribbean coasts, and the Andes mountain range running through, creating ideal coffee-growing microclimates.

### Growing Conditions

**Altitude Range**: 1,200 - 2,000 meters above sea level (MASL)
- Sweet spot: 1,400-1,800 MASL for premium coffees
- Three Andean mountain chains (cordilleras) create diverse growing zones
- Volcanic soil rich in nutrients

**Climate**:
- **Temperature**: 17-23°C (63-73°F) average in coffee zones
- **Rainfall**: 1,800-2,800mm annually
- **No Distinct Dry Season**: Bimodal rainfall allows year-round harvesting
- **Main Harvest**: October-December (60% of production)
- **Mitaca (Fly Crop)**: April-June (40% of production)

**Key Advantage**: Year-round production means fresh Colombian coffee is almost always available, unlike single-harvest origins.

**Soil**: Volcanic, nutrient-rich, well-draining, high organic content
