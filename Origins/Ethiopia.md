---

## 📍 Geography & Climate

### Location
Ethiopia sits in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Sudan. The country's high-altitude plateaus and mountainous terrain create ideal conditions for coffee cultivation.

### Growing Conditions

**Altitude Range**: 1,400 - 2,200 meters above sea level (MASL)
- Sweet spot: 1,800-2,100 MASL for premium coffees
- Higher altitudes → slower maturation → more complex flavors
- Temperature fluctuations at altitude enhance flavor development

**Climate**:
- **Temperature**: 15-25°C (59-77°F) average in growing regions
- **Rainfall**: 1,200-2,800mm annually, bimodal rainy seasons
- **Dry Season**: December-February (harvest period)
- **Main Rainy Season**: June-September
- **Short Rains**: March-April

**Soil**: Rich volcanic soil, naturally fertile, mineral-dense

## 🗺️ Major Growing Regions

### Yirgacheffe (Gedeo Zone)

**Altitude**: 1,750-2,200 MASL  
**Processing**: Primarily washed, some naturals  
**Flavor Profile**: Floral (jasmine, bergamot), tea-like, citrus (lemon, lime), stone fruit, honey sweetness  
**Character**: Clean, bright acidity, light-medium body, highly aromatic

**Notes**: The most famous Ethiopian coffee region. Yirgacheffe is actually a town within the Gedeo Zone but has become synonymous with a specific flavor profile. Known for incredibly complex, perfume-like aromatics.

### Sidamo (Sidama)

**Altitude**: 1,400-2,200 MASL  
**Processing**: Washed and natural  
**Flavor Profile**: Blueberry, strawberry, tropical fruits, wine-like, floral, complex

### Guji

**Altitude**: 1,800-2,300 MASL  
**Processing**: Washed and natural  
**Flavor Profile**: Peach, apricot, berry, floral, complex, sweet  
**Character**: Medium-full body, juicy, vibrant acidity

**Processing**: Washed and natural  
**Flavor Profile**: Tea-like, floral, fruity, honey

## 🌱 Coffee Varietals

### Heirloom Varieties

Ethiopia is unique in that it has thousands of indigenous, wild arabica varieties. Rather than specific cultivars, Ethiopian coffees are typically labeled "heirloom" or "indigenous varieties."

**Characteristics**:
- Genetic diversity unmatched anywhere else in world
- Wild coffee forests still exist
- Natural mutation and adaptation over millennia
- Each microregion has unique local varieties

**Common Heirloom Types**:
- Kurume
- Wolisho  
- Dega
- 74110, 74112 (improved varieties from Jimma Agricultural Research Center)

**Why It Matters**: This diversity is Ethiopia's greatest strength. It provides incredible flavor complexity and is crucial for global coffee genetic diversity.

## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Washed (Wet) Processing

**Process**:
1. Cherry picked ripe
2. Depulped to remove fruit
3. Fermented 24-48 hours in water tanks
4. Washed to remove mucilage
5. Dried on raised beds 10-14 days

**Result**: Clean, bright, floral, tea-like. Highlights intrinsic bean character.

**Best Regions**: Yirgacheffe, Limu, Guji (washed)

### Natural (Dry) Processing

**Process**:
1. Cherry picked ripe
2. Dried whole (with fruit) on raised beds or patios
3. 3-4 weeks drying time
4. Fruit removed after drying

**Result**: Fruity, berry-forward, wine-like, full body. Fruit imparts flavors into bean.

**Best Regions**: Harrar, Sidamo, Guji (natural)

### Honey/Pulped Natural

**Less Common**: Some producers experimenting with honey processing (partial fruit removal), but not traditional in Ethiopia.

## 📊 Coffee Industry Structure

### Farm Size & Organization

**70% Smallholder Farmers**: 
- Plots of 0.5-2 hectares (1-5 acres)
- Often intercropped with other crops (false banana, fruit trees)
- Coffee is cash crop alongside subsistence farming
- Family-operated, passed down generations

**15% Garden Coffee**:
- Grown in backyards and homesteads
- Not primary income source
- Casual cultivation

**15% Semi-Forest & Forest Coffee**:
- Wild or semi-wild coffee in forests
- Harvested but not intensively cultivated
- Ecologically diverse systems

### Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX)

Established 2008 to increase transparency and efficiency:
- Most coffee sold through ECX auction system
- Traceability was historically limited (improving now)
- Direct trade and specialty lots increasingly bypass ECX
- Recent reforms allow more traceability

### Cooperatives & Washing Stations

- Many smallholders belong to cooperatives
- Cooperatives own central washing stations
- Quality control and processing done centrally
- Fair trade and organic certifications common
- Notable co-ops: Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU)
