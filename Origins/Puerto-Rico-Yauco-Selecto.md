# Puerto Rico - Yauco Selecto and Mountain Coffee

## Overview

Puerto Rico, a U.S. Caribbean territory, produces small volumes of highly regarded specialty coffee with a rich historical legacy dating to the 18th century. Once a major global coffee exporter in the 19th century (4th largest exporter in 1890s), the industry declined dramatically in the 20th century due to hurricanes, economic changes, and competition from U.S. minimum wage requirements. Today, Puerto Rican coffee production is boutique-scale (approximately 300-500 metric tons annually), focused on premium quality, with the legendary "Yauco Selecto" denomination representing the finest mountain-grown coffees from the southwestern Yauco region.

**Geographic Context**: Puerto Rico is a mountainous Caribbean island located between the Dominican Republic and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Cordillera Central (central mountain range) runs east-west across the island, providing ideal coffee-growing conditions at elevations of 300-1,200 meters. Coffee cultivation is concentrated in the western and central mountainous municipalities: Yauco, Adjuntas, Maricao, Lares, Las Marías, and Utuado.

**Coffee History**: Coffee was introduced to Puerto Rico in 1736, with commercial cultivation expanding rapidly in the 19th century. By the 1890s, Puerto Rico was among the world's top coffee exporters, with "Puerto Rico Coffee" commanding premium prices in Europe, particularly in the Vatican and Spanish royal court. Hurricane San Ciriaco in 1899 devastated the industry, and U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico (1898) led to economic restructuring favoring sugar over coffee. The 20th century brought continued decline: hurricanes (frequent in Caribbean), U.S. minimum wage laws making production expensive, competition from cheaper origins, and urbanization reducing agricultural labor. The 1990s-2000s saw revival efforts through specialty coffee focus, the "Yauco Selecto" denomination (established 1990s), government support programs, and quality improvement initiatives. Hurricanes Irma and María (2017) devastated the industry again (~80% crop loss), but rebuilding efforts continue.

**Current Production Statistics**:
- Annual production: 300-500 metric tons (5,000-8,000 bags) - extremely limited
- Pre-Hurricane María (2017): 800-1,200 metric tons
- Recovery ongoing from 2017 hurricane devastation
- Cultivated area: ~2,000-3,000 hectares (down from 7,000+ hectares pre-María)
- Number of farms: approximately 400-600 active coffee farms (down from 1,000+)
- Average farm size: 3-8 hectares
- Domestic consumption: 90-95% (Puerto Rico consumes far more coffee than it produces, importing heavily)
- Export: 5-10% (very limited, primarily U.S. mainland specialty market, diaspora)
- Production challenges: Hurricane recovery, high labor costs, aging farmers, climate change, competition from cheaper imports
