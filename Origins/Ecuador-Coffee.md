## 📋 Overview

Ecuador produces distinctive specialty coffee from two dramatically different terroirs - Andean highland coffees with balanced chocolate-floral profiles, and ultra-rare Galápagos Island coffee from volcanic islands 600 miles offshore. While small in volume, Ecuador punches above its weight in uniqueness, quality potential, and specialty intrigue, particularly with the innovative Sidra variety gaining international recognition.

**What Makes Ecuador Unique**:
- **Galápagos Coffee**: World's most remote coffee origin, tiny production, protected ecosystem
- **Sidra Variety**: Ecuadorian specialty - unique variety gaining competition recognition
- **Andean Terroir**: High-altitude volcanic slopes, equatorial location
- **Organic Focus**: Significant organic production (smallholder farming)
- **Equatorial**: Straddling equator, consistent daylight, year-round production potential
- **Underrated**: Quality exceeds international recognition
- **Diversity**: Andean vs. Island coffees offer completely different experiences
- **Innovation**: Early adopter of specialty processing, experimentation

**Geographic Peculiarity**:
- **Mainland**: Andean highlands, volcanic soil, traditional coffee regions
- **Galápagos Islands**: 600 miles offshore, volcanic islands, protected national park, minimal coffee (200-500 bags annually), ultra-rare, expensive
