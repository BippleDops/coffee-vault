- **Passes**: 3-5 selective passes during harvest season
- **Quality Control**: Visual inspection, floatation test
- **Timing**: Same-day delivery to wet mill critical
- **Labor**: Family labor + hired pickers (peak season)

**Step 2: Reception & Sorting**:
- **Floatation**: Cherries in water tank
  - Ripe sink (proceed to pulping)
  - Unripe/damaged float (removed)
- **Visual Sorting**: Additional quality check
- **Weighing**: Payment calculation
- **Timing**: Process within 6-8 hours of harvest

**Step 3: Pulping (Despulpado)**:
- **Equipment**: Eco-pulper or traditional disc pulper
- **Process**: Removes skin and most fruit pulp
- **Water Use**:
  - Traditional: 40 liters/kg parchment
  - Eco-pulper: 1-5 liters/kg (major improvement)
- **Byproduct**: Pulp (composted or discarded)
- **Result**: Coffee in parchment with mucilage layer

**Step 4: Fermentation (Fermentación)**:
- **Method**: Dry fermentation (no water added) or wet
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours depending on temperature
  - Cooler (15-18°C): 18-24 hours
  - Warmer (20-25°C): 12-18 hours
- **Container**: Fermentation tanks (concrete, plastic, or tile)
- **Purpose**: Enzymatic breakdown of mucilage
- **Monitoring**: Regular checking for completion
  - Test: Rough texture when mucilage removed
  - Risk: Over-fermentation creates sour defects

**Step 5: Washing (Lavado)**:
- **Method**: Washing channels (canals)
- **Process**:
  - Coffee flows through declining channels
  - Agitation and friction remove mucilage
  - Density separation occurs (defects float)
  - Multiple wash cycles
- **Water Use**: 20-30 liters/kg parchment
- **Duration**: 2-4 cycles through channels
- **Result**: Clean parchment coffee

**Step 6: Drying (Secado)**:
