## 📋 Overview

Peru has emerged as the world's leading organic coffee producer and a South American specialty powerhouse, transforming from coca-growing regions to high-quality, sustainably produced coffee that competes with Colombia and Brazil while maintaining exceptional environmental and social credentials.

**Why Peruvian Coffee Stands Out**:
- **#1 Organic Producer Globally**: Largest organic coffee exporter worldwide
- **Fair Trade Leader**: Extensive fair trade certification (50%+ of exports)
- **High Altitude**: Andean slopes provide 1,200-2,100 MASL ideal conditions
- **Smallholder Cooperatives**: 95%+ of coffee from small family farms
- **Quality Evolution**: From commodity to specialty over past 20 years
- **Unique Position**: Andean terroir creates distinctive South American profile
- **Value**: Exceptional quality-to-price ratio
- **Diverse Regions**: Six major growing zones with distinct profiles
- **Clean Cup**: Washed processing excellence, clarity and balance

**Historical Context**:
- **1700s**: Coffee introduced by Spanish colonists
- **1800s-1900s**: Limited production, overshadowed by neighbors
- **1970s-1990s**: Coca cultivation dominant in some regions (drug trade)
- **1990s-2000s**: Coffee as alternative development crop (UN programs)
- **2000s**: Organic certification surge, cooperative structure strengthens
- **2010s**: Specialty recognition grows, Cup of Excellence begins (2017)
- **Present**: Established specialty origin, organic and fair trade leader

**The Organic Story**:
- Smallholder farms couldn't afford chemical inputs
- Poverty became advantage: "organic by default"
- Certification formalizes existing practices
- Premiums support farmer livelihoods
- Peru now synonymous with organic coffee
