# 🌍 India - Monsooned Malabar Coffee

**Region**: Malabar Coast (Karnataka, Kerala States)  
**Unique Processing**: Monsooning (Exposure to Monsoon Winds)  
**Annual Production**: Variable (specialty process, ~5-10% of Indian coffee)  
**Primary Species**: Arabica and Robusta (both monsooned)

---

## 📋 Overview

India Monsooned Malabar is coffee's most unusual processing method - exposing coffee beans to monsoon winds for 3-4 months, dramatically transforming flavor, color, and body in ways no other process achieves. This unique Indian specialty creates heavy-bodied, low-acid, earthy-spicy coffees perfect for dark roasting and espresso.

**What Makes Monsooning Unique**:
- **Only Origin**: Monsooning unique to India (Malabar Coast specifically)
- **Monsoon Exposure**: Beans exposed to humid monsoon winds (June-September)
- **Transformation**: Color (green → pale yellow/brown), flavor (mild → earthy-spicy), body (light → very heavy)
- **Historical Accident**: Discovered accidentally during sailing ship era
- **Intentional Process**: Now done deliberately for specialty market
- **Full Body**: Among heaviest-bodied coffees globally
- **Low Acid**: Extremely low acidity (aged character)
- **Polarizing**: Unique, divisive flavor profile
- **Aged Character**: Similar to aged Indonesian coffees

**Historical Origin**:
- **1600s-1800s**: Indian coffee shipped to Europe in wooden ships
- **Sailing Ships**: Journey took 4-6 months around Cape of Good Hope
- **Monsoon Passage**: Ships passed through monsoon season
- **Exposure**: Coffee in wooden hulls exposed to humid monsoon winds
- **Transformation**: Beans changed color, flavor, body during voyage
- **European Preference**: Europeans became accustomed to this "aged" character
- **Steam Ships**: Faster shipping (weeks not months) produced different coffee
- **Customer Complaints**: Europeans complained new coffee didn't taste like old
- **Solution**: Deliberately expose coffee to monsoon winds (monsooning born)
- **Present**: Specialty process, niche market, uniquely Indian

## 🔄 The Monsooning Process

### Step-by-Step

**Timing**: June-September (Southwest Monsoon Season)

**Process**:

1. **Initial Selection** (May-June):
   - Wet-processed (washed) coffee selected
   - Still in parchment (protective layer)
   - Quality coffee chosen (not defects)

2. **Warehouse Preparation** (June):
   - Coffee spread in open-sided warehouses
   - Warehouses face monsoon winds (open to elements)
   - Location: Malabar Coast (Karnataka, Kerala)
   - Thickness: 10-15cm layers

3. **Monsoon Exposure** (June-September, 12-16 weeks):
   - **Humid Winds**: Monsoon winds blow through warehouse
   - **Moisture Absorption**: Beans absorb humidity from air
   - **Swelling**: Beans swell, expand significantly (50-100% size increase)
   - **Color Change**: Green → Pale yellow → Golden brown
   - **Raking**: Beans raked weekly (ensure even exposure, prevent mold)
   - **Rotation**: Moved to different positions regularly
   - **Monitoring**: Constant supervision (mold prevention critical)

4. **Progression**:
   - **Week 1-4**: Initial moisture absorption, slight swelling
   - **Week 5-8**: Significant swelling, color changes accelerate
   - **Week 9-12**: Maximum swelling achieved, color fully transformed
   - **Week 13-16**: Final exposure, stabilization

5. **Post-Monsoon**:
   - **Hulling**: Parchment removed (beans fragile, swollen)
   - **Sorting**: Size sorting, density separation
   - **Grading**: Quality grading (AA, A, B, etc.)
   - **Final Color**: Pale yellow to light brown (distinctive)

6. **Packaging & Export**:
   - **Moisture Content**: 13-14% (higher than normal 11-12%)
   - **Appearance**: Pale, swollen, fragile beans
   - **Shipping**: Must ship carefully (beans fragile)
