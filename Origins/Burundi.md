## 📋 Overview

Burundi produces exceptional specialty coffee that rivals Rwanda and Kenya in brightness and complexity, yet remains largely unknown outside specialty circles. Despite political instability, poverty, and infrastructure challenges, Burundian coffee delivers bright berry-citrus-floral profiles at remarkable value, representing one of East African coffee's best-kept secrets.

**Why Burundi Deserves Recognition**:

- **Cooperative Model**: Washing stations serve smallholders
- **Improving**: Quality focus increasing, specialty recognition growing
- **Cup of Excellence**: Showcased exceptional lots (87-92+ points)

**Historical & Political Context**:
- **Coffee Introduction**: 1920s-1930s (Belgian colonial era)
- **Bourbon Establishment**: Belgian colonists planted Red Bourbon extensively
- **Independence** (1962): Coffee becomes primary export
- **Civil War** (1993-2005): Devastating conflict, coffee industry damaged
- **Post-Conflict** (2005-Present): Slow recovery, quality focus emerges
- **Challenges**: Political instability ongoing, infrastructure limited, poverty widespread
- **Coffee's Role**: 80% of export revenue, 800,000 farming families (60% of population)

**Current Situation**:
- Coffee is lifeline for nation
