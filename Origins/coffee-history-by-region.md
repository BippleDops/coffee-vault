**Specialty Era Varieties (1990-Present)**:
- **Geisha/Gesha** (1930s introduction, 2004+ fame): Ethiopian origin, rediscovered in Panama, exceptional quality
- **SL-28, SL-34 Revival**: Specialty market values quality genetics
- **Bourbon, Typica Heritage**: Resurgence despite low yield (quality premium justifies)
- **Experimental**: F1 hybrids, new crosses balancing quality, yield, climate resilience

## 6. Processing Method Evolution by Region

**Natural/Dry Processing** (Oldest method, still dominant in many origins):
- **Origin**: Ethiopia, Yemen (traditional)
- **Spread**: Brazil (climate suits), East Africa, Indonesia
- **Method**: Whole cherry sun-dried, fermentation occurs in fruit
- **Flavor**: Fruit-forward, heavy body, lower acidity
- **Evolution**: Specialty natural processing (careful sorting, raised beds, monitoring) vs. traditional patio drying

**Washed/Wet Processing** (Developed 1800s):
- **Origins**: Colombia (identity), Central America, Kenya (double fermentation), India
- **Method**: Depulp, ferment (12-48 hours), wash, dry parchment
- **Flavor**: Clean, bright acidity, clarity
- **Infrastructure**: Requires water, wet mills, washing channels
- **Evolution**: Extended fermentation, controlled fermentation, water conservation methods

**Wet-Hulled/Giling Basah** (1900s Indonesia):
- **Origin**: Sumatra, Indonesia (climate-driven innovation)
- **Method**: Remove parchment at high moisture, dry green bean
- **Flavor**: Earthy, full-bodied, herbaceous, low acidity
- **Unique**: Only Indonesia widely uses (controversial in specialty for quality inconsistency)

**Honey/Pulped Natural Processing** (1990s-2000s):
- **Origin**: Brazil (pulped natural/semi-washed 1990s), Costa Rica (honey variations 2000s)
- **Method**: Depulp, leave mucilage, dry with mucilage on parchment
- **Variations**: Yellow, red, black honey (mucilage amount, drying speed)
- **Flavor**: Sweet, balanced between washed and natural
- **Spread**: Globally adopted in specialty coffee (2010s+)

**Experimental Processing** (2010s+):
- **Anaerobic Fermentation**: Sealed tanks, controlled environment, CO2 buildup, wine-like flavors
- **Carbonic Maceration**: Whole cherry in CO2 environment (wine technique)
- **Yeast/Bacteria Inoculation**: Controlled fermentation with specific cultures
- **Extended Fermentation**: 72+ hours, complex acidity and fruit development
- **Thermal Shock**: Temperature manipulation during fermentation
- **Spread**: Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Ethiopia, others experimenting

**Monsooned Processing** (1800s India, unique):
- **Origin**: Accidental (sailing ship exposure to monsoon), formalized India
- **Method**: Expose beans to monsoon humidity (80-90%), beans swell, acidity drops
- **Flavor**: Earthy, spicy, heavy body, almost zero acidity
- **Unique**: Only India produces at scale
