## 📋 Overview

Cauca is Colombia's experimental coffee frontier - southwestern department where progressive producers push processing boundaries through anaerobic fermentation, carbonic maceration, and wild fermentations while growing cutting-edge varieties (Pink Bourbon, Gesha, Tabi) at extreme altitudes. Cauca represents Colombian specialty's innovative edge and experimental spirit.

**Why Cauca is Revolutionary**:
- **Processing Innovation**: Anaerobic, carbonic maceration, extended fermentation pioneers
- **Extreme Altitude**: Up to 2,200 MASL (among Colombia's highest)
- **Pink Bourbon Hub**: Significant Pink Bourbon cultivation
- **Gesha Trials**: Experimental Gesha plantings (high altitude suitable)
- **Progressive Producers**: Early adopters of cutting-edge techniques
- **Competition Success**: Experimental Cauca lots win awards, fetch premium auction prices
- **Quality Obsession**: Specialty-focused, not commodity
- **Unique Profiles**: Fruit-forward, funky, wine-like coffees unlike typical Colombian

**Geographic Context**:
- **Southwest Colombia**: Between Nariño (south) and Huila (east)
- **Mountains**: Andean highlands, volcanic influence
- **Cool**: High-altitude cool temperatures
- **Indigenous**: Strong indigenous Nasa, Misak, Guambiano presence
- **Conflict History**: FARC conflict zone (peace since 2016), coffee as economic alternative
