## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Natural (Dry) - Traditional Brazilian Method

**Process**:
1. Cherries picked (mix of ripe and unripe - strip picking common)
2. Dried whole on patios or raised beds
3. 20-30 days drying in sun
4. Turned regularly
5. Husked after drying

**Result**: Sweet, heavy body, low acidity, nutty, chocolate

**Why Dominant**: 
- Brazil's dry harvest season ideal for natural processing
- Less water needed (important in some regions)
- Traditional method
- Matches market expectations ("Brazilian taste")

### Pulped Natural (Semi-Washed)

**Process**:
1. Cherries depulped (fruit removed)
2. Dried with mucilage still attached
3. No fermentation or washing stage
4. Dried on patios (faster than full natural)

**Result**: Between washed and natural - some body, some brightness, sweet

**Advantages**:
- Faster drying than full natural
- Less water than fully washed
- Unique Brazilian specialty

### Fully Washed (Less Common)

**Status**: Growing in specialty segment  
**Process**: Standard washed (ferment, wash, dry parchment)  
**Result**: Brighter acidity, cleaner than natural  
**Market**: Specialty roasters seeking different Brazilian profile
