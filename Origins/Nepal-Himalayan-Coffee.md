# Nepal - Himalayan Specialty Coffee

## Overview

Nepal represents one of the world's most exciting emerging specialty coffee origins, producing small volumes of exceptional Arabica coffee in the foothills of the Himalayas. Despite coffee cultivation dating back to the 1930s, commercial production only gained momentum in the 1990s, and specialty-grade coffee has emerged in the past two decades through focused development programs and smallholder cooperative models.

**Geographic Context**: Nestled between India and China in the Himalayas, Nepal's unique position provides ideal microclimates for coffee cultivation. The country's mountainous terrain creates diverse growing conditions, with coffee farms primarily concentrated in the mid-hills ranging from 800 to 1,800 meters above sea level.

**Coffee History**: Coffee was introduced to Nepal in 1938 by Hira Giri, a hermit who brought seeds from Myanmar. Initial cultivation remained minimal until the late 1970s when government programs promoted coffee as a cash crop alternative to replace declining cardamom production. The real transformation began in the 1990s with NGO support, particularly from GTZ (German Technical Cooperation) and Winrock International, which established processing infrastructure and cooperative structures.

**Current Production Statistics**:
- Annual production: approximately 500-700 metric tons (8,000-11,000 bags)
- Cultivated area: ~1,600 hectares
- Number of farmers: approximately 25,000-30,000 smallholders
- Average farm size: 0.05-0.2 hectares
- Export volume: 60-70% of production (primarily to Japan, South Korea, USA, Europe)
- Production growth rate: 5-8% annually

## Climate & Geography

### Altitude Ranges

**Primary Growing Zones**:
- **800-1,000 MASL**: Lower elevation zones in Kaski and Palpa districts
- **1,000-1,400 MASL**: Optimal zone for balanced acidity and sweetness (Gulmi, Syangja)
- **1,400-1,800 MASL**: High-elevation specialty lots with pronounced acidity and complexity (Lalitpur, Sindhupalchowk)

The high-altitude coffees show exceptional clarity and floral characteristics comparable to Ethiopian naturals, while mid-elevation coffees offer more balanced, approachable profiles.

### Rainfall Patterns

**Annual Rainfall**: 1,500-2,500 mm
- **Monsoon Season** (June-September): 80% of annual rainfall, 300-500mm monthly
- **Post-Monsoon** (October-November): Decreasing, 50-100mm monthly
- **Winter** (December-February): Dry season, 10-30mm monthly
- **Pre-Monsoon** (March-May): Increasing, 50-150mm monthly

The monsoon climate creates challenges for drying but contributes to healthy plant growth. The dry winter harvest period allows for optimal processing conditions.

### Temperature Ranges

**Seasonal Variations**:
- **Summer** (May-August): 20-30°C (68-86°F)
- **Winter** (December-February): 5-20°C (41-68°F)
- **Harvest Period** (November-March): 10-25°C (50-77°F)

**Diurnal Temperature Variation**: 10-15°C, contributing to slow cherry maturation and sugar development.

### Soil Composition

**Soil Types**:
- **Brown Forest Soil**: Most common in mid-hills, slightly acidic, good drainage
- **Red-Yellow Soil**: Higher elevations, rich in iron oxide
- **Alluvial Soil**: River valleys, high organic content
- **pH Range**: 5.5-6.5 (ideal for Arabica)

The volcanic parent rock in some regions contributes mineral complexity similar to Central American profiles. Organic matter content varies from 2-5%, with smallholder farms typically maintaining higher organic levels through traditional farming practices.

### Microclimate Factors

**Himalayan Influence**:
- Cool mountain breezes create temperature moderation
- Glacial meltwater provides consistent irrigation sources
- Valley systems create protected microclimates
- Steep slopes ensure excellent drainage
- High elevation sunlight intensity

**Shade Systems**:
- 70-80% of farms use shade trees (traditional practice)
- Common shade species: Alnus nepalensis (Alder), Grevillea robusta, Ficus species
- Multi-story agroforestry: cardamom, ginger, turmeric intercropped
- Natural forest canopy in some areas
