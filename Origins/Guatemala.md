## 🔄 Processing Methods

### Washed (Fully Washed) - Dominant

**Process** (Guatemala's meticulous approach):
1. Selective picking (ripe cherries only)
2. Pulping within hours of harvest
3. Fermentation 12-48 hours (varies by altitude/temperature)
4. Washing in channels (removes all mucilage)
5. Drying on patios or raised beds (10-20 days)
6. **Key**: Multiple water washes ensure cleanliness

**Result**: Clean, bright, chocolate-forward with good acidity

**Why Dominant**: Tradition, infrastructure, market preference, showcases terroir

### Honey Processing (Growing)

**Status**: Increasing experimentation, especially premium farms  
**Process**: Pulped, some mucilage retained, dried  
**Result**: More body, fruit-forward, sweeter than fully washed  
**Market**: Specialty buyers seek for variety

### Natural (Rare)

**Status**: Uncommon due to humidity challenges  
**Process**: Dried whole (cherry with fruit)  
**Result**: Fruit-forward, wine-like, full body  
**Availability**: Limited, mostly micro-lots
