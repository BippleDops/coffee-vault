### Hydrological Features

Nyeri is blessed with exceptional water resources, critical for Kenya's water-intensive processing:

**Water Sources**:
- **Mount Kenya Rivers**: Radial drainage creates permanent rivers
  - **Sagana River**: Major river, flows through Nyeri
  - **Rupingazi River**: Central Nyeri
  - **Gura River**: Northern region
  - **Thuchi River**: Southern area
- **Springs**: Mountain springs abundant (year-round flow)
- **Rainfall**: 1,200-2,000mm annually (reliable)
- **Water Table**: High (shallow wells 10-30m depth)

**Importance for Coffee Processing**:
- Kenya's signature **double fermentation** requires abundant clean water
- Washing stations need 3-5 liters water per kg parchment
- Multiple fermentation cycles demand continuous flow
- Water quality affects cup quality (mineral content)
- Year-round availability enables consistent processing

**Watersheds**:
- **Tana River Basin**: Largest, fed by Mount Kenya
- **Ewaso Ng'iro Basin**: Northern region

## 📜 History & Coffee Heritage

### Pre-Colonial Era

**Indigenous Peoples**: Kikuyu people (Agikuyu) inhabited Nyeri region
- Agricultural society, terraced farming
- Mount Kenya sacred (Kirinyaga - "Mountain of Brightness")
- No coffee cultivation (native to Ethiopia, not Kenya)

### Colonial Introduction of Coffee (1900-1920s)

**British Colonial Period**:
- **1893**: First coffee planted in Kenya (near Nairobi)
- **Early 1900s**: Coffee introduced to Nyeri region
- **European Settlers**: Large estates established in highlands
- **1933**: Coffee Act passed
  - **Restriction**: Native Africans prohibited from growing coffee
  - **Reason**: Protect settler monopoly, prevent competition
  - **Impact**: Coffee = colonial cash crop, African exclusion

**Settler Estates**:
- Large farms (100-500+ acres) in Nyeri highlands
- European-owned plantations
- African labor exploited (low wages, harsh conditions)
- High-quality coffee produced (but wealth extracted)

- **Cooperative Formation**: African farmers organized for collective power

**Post-WWII Changes**:
- **1946**: Swynnerton Plan (economic reform)
- **1950s**: Restrictions gradually eased
- African smallholder coffee expanded
- Cooperative societies strengthened

### Independence Era & Coffee Expansion (1960s-1970s)

**Kenya Independence** (1963):

**Step 1: Cherry Harvest & Sorting**:
- **Timing**: October-December (main), May-July (fly crop)
- **Method**: Hand-picking, only ripe cherries
- **Passes**: 5-7 selective passes (rigorous)
- **Quality**: 95-98% ripe cherry target
- **Transport**: Same-day delivery to factory (within 6 hours ideal)
- **Reception**: Weighing, quality check

**Step 2: Initial Sorting**:
- **Floatation**: Cherries in water tanks
  - Ripe, dense cherries sink
  - Unripe, damaged, insect-damaged float (removed)
- **Visual Sorting**: Additional hand sorting
- **Quality Control**: Only best cherries proceed

**Step 3: Pulping**:
- **Equipment**: Mechanical disc pulpers
- **Process**: Skin and most pulp removed
- **Result**: Coffee in parchment with mucilage layer
- **Byproduct**: Pulp (composted)
- **Timing**: Within 12 hours of harvest

**Step 4: First Fermentation (Dry Fermentation)**:
- **Method**: Beans in tanks WITHOUT water
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours (temperature-dependent)
  - Cool temps (15-18°C): 18-24 hours
  - Warmer temps (20-25°C): 12-18 hours
- **Container**: Concrete or tile fermentation tanks
- **Purpose**: Enzymatic mucilage breakdown
- **Monitoring**: Regular checking, pH monitoring
- **Completion Test**: Rough, gritty texture when mucilage broken down

**Step 5: Washing (Mucilage Removal)**:
- **Method**: Washing channels (declining concrete channels)
- **Process**:
  - Beans flow through channels with water
  - Agitation and friction remove mucilage
  - Density separation occurs (defects float, removed)
  - Multiple passes through channels
- **Water Volume**: 3-5 liters per kg parchment
- **Duration**: 2-4 cycles
- **Result**: Clean parchment (mucilage removed)

**Step 6: Second Fermentation (Wet Fermentation) - THE KENYAN DIFFERENCE**:
- **Method**: Clean parchment submerged in clean water tanks
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours
- **Temperature**: Ambient (15-20°C)
- **Purpose**:
  - **Further Cleaning**: Any remaining mucilage trace removal
  - **Flavor Development**: Fermentation continues, develops complexity
  - **Brightness Enhancement**: Creates signature Kenyan acidity
- **Chemistry**:
  - Pectinase enzymes continue working
  - Acetic acid bacteria activity (flavor precursors)
  - pH drops (acid development)
- **Monitoring**: Taste testing, pH checks
- **Risk**: Over-fermentation creates sour defects (must stop at right time)

**Step 7: Final Soaking**:
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours in clean water
- **Purpose**:
  - Final cleaning
  - Moisture equilibration
  - Flavor stabilization
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water (changed)
- **Result**: Perfectly clean parchment

**Total Fermentation + Soaking Time**: 36-72 hours (much longer than standard washed processing)

**Step 8: Drying**:
- **Method**: Raised drying tables (African beds)
- **Surface**: Wire mesh or bamboo mats (air circulation underneath)
- **Initial Moisture**: ~55% after washing
- **Target**: 10.5-11.5% (Kenyan standard, lower than most)
- **Duration**: 10-14 days (weather-dependent)
- **Management**:
  - **Thin Layers**: 1-2 cm depth initially
  - **Turning**: Every 30-60 minutes (very frequent)
  - **Sorting**: Continuous defect removal during drying
  - **Shade**: Partial shade during hottest hours
  - **Night Protection**: Covered to prevent moisture reabsorption
  - **Rain Protection**: Quick covering essential
- **Drying Stages**:
  - **Days 1-3**: Constant turning, high moisture loss
  - **Days 4-7**: Reduced turning (2-3x daily), moisture stabilizing
  - **Days 8-14**: Slow drying to target moisture, turning 1-2x daily

**Step 9: Dry Parchment Storage**:
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks minimum before milling
- **Storage**: In parchment (protective layer)
- **Conditions**: Cool, dry warehouse
- **Purpose**: Moisture equilibration, flavor stabilization

**Step 10: Dry Milling & Grading**:
- **Timing**: Before auction or sale
- **Hulling**: Parchment removed mechanically
- **Grading**: Kenya's famous grading system

**Kenyan Coffee Grades**:
1. **AA**: Screen size 17-18 (6.75-7.2mm) - largest, premium
2. **AB**: Screen size 15-16 (6.0-6.75mm) - standard export grade
3. **PB** (Peaberry): Single round bean (genetic variation), ~10% of crop
4. **C**: Screen size 14-15 (smaller beans)
5. **E** (Elephant): Extra-large (rare, two beans fused)
6. **TT**: Small beans from AA/AB (light, broken)
7. **T**: Smallest fragments

**Additional Sorting**:
- **Density Tables**: Separate by density (high density = higher quality)
- **Color Sorting**: Electronic or hand sorting removes defects
- **Final Product**: Green coffee by grade

#### Why Double Fermentation Creates Distinctive Profile

**Chemical Effects**:
- **Extended Fermentation**: Develops more flavor precursors
- **Organic Acids**: Increased production (citric, malic, acetic acid precursors)
- **Amino Acids**: Breakdown creates flavor complexity
- **pH Change**: Lower pH enhances brightness perception

**Cup Profile Impact**:
- **Acidity**: Brighter, more complex, layered (phosphoric, citric, malic)
- **Clarity**: Exceptional clarity and transparency
- **Fruit**: Fruit flavors amplified and defined
- **Sweetness**: Complex sweetness (balances acidity)
- **Body**: Medium body (not heavy despite complexity)
- **Finish**: Long, evolving, complex

**Comparison to Standard Washed**:
- **Standard Washed** (single fermentation):
  - Clean, bright, balanced
  - 83-86 points typical
- **Kenyan Double Fermentation**:
  - Explosive, complex, intense
  - 85-92 points potential
- **Difference**: Intensity and complexity (2-6 point difference)

### Natural Processing (Emerging)

**Prevalence**: <5% in Nyeri (experimental)

**Challenges in Nyeri**:
- **Rainfall**: High rainfall during harvest (rain risk)
- **Humidity**: High ambient humidity (slow drying, mold risk)
- **Tradition**: Kenyan market expects washed profile
- **Infrastructure**: Drying space limited (most set up for washed)

**Process**:
- Whole cherry dried on raised beds
- 3-4 weeks drying time
- Constant attention, sorting
- Greenhouse drying often used (rain protection)

**Results When Successful**:
- **Flavor**: Berry-forward, wine-like, complex
- **Body**: Fuller, syrupy
- **Acidity**: Lower, fruit-driven
- **Market**: Experimental, specialty lots
- **Reception**: Mixed (traditional buyers prefer washed)

**Notable Producers**:
- Some factories experimenting
- Small lots for specialty buyers
- Higher risk, higher potential reward

- **Grind**: Coarse
- **Result**: Full body, muted brightness

**Espresso**:
- **Challenge**: High acidity can be too intense
- **Success**: Requires careful dialing in
- **Ratio**: 1:2 to 1:2.5 (18g:36-45g)
