# Philippines - Cordillera Mountain Coffee

## Overview

The Philippines is a unique coffee origin with a rich coffee history dating to the 18th century, producing all four commercial coffee species (Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa). While the country fell from being the world's 4th largest producer in the 1880s to a net coffee importer today, a specialty coffee renaissance is underway, particularly in the Cordillera mountain regions of Northern Luzon (Benguet, Sagada) where high-elevation Arabica and the distinctive Liberica "Barako" coffee are cultivated by indigenous communities.

**Geographic Context**: The Philippine archipelago comprises over 7,000 islands with mountainous terrain providing diverse coffee-growing microclimates. The Cordillera Administrative Region in Northern Luzon features rugged mountains reaching 2,000+ meters, with coffee cultivation concentrated at 800-1,800 MASL. Mindanao in the south and Batangas near Manila are other significant coffee-producing regions.

**Coffee History**: Coffee was introduced by Spanish colonizers in 1740, with Batangas becoming a major Liberica producer by the 1860s. By the 1880s, the Philippines was the 4th largest coffee exporter globally, shipping primarily to Europe and the United States. Coffee leaf rust devastation in the 1890s decimated production, and the industry never fully recovered. The 20th century saw decline, with the country becoming a net importer by the 1960s. The 21st century has brought renewed interest, with organizations like the Philippine Coffee Board and specialty coffee advocates working to revive quality production, particularly in Cordillera highlands and Mindanao regions.

**Current Production Statistics**:
- Annual production: approximately 25,000-30,000 metric tons total (all species)
- Arabica production: ~10,000-12,000 metric tons (40% of total)
- Liberica production: ~3,000-5,000 metric tons (distinctive to Philippines)
- Robusta production: ~12,000-15,000 metric tons (primarily Mindanao)
- Cultivated area: ~120,000-130,000 hectares total
- Number of farmers: approximately 250,000-300,000 (mostly smallholders)
- Average farm size: 0.5-2 hectares
- Consumption vs. Production: Net importer (domestic consumption exceeds production)
- Specialty coffee production: Growing but <5% of total
