## 📋 Overview

Mexico represents a unique position in coffee geography - North America's only significant coffee producer, with rich indigenous heritage, extensive organic production, and proximity to the massive US coffee market. Despite challenges from climate change and economic pressures, Mexico continues producing distinctive, high-quality coffees with chocolate-forward, balanced profiles and exceptional organic/shade-grown credentials.

**Why Mexican Coffee Matters**:
- **Organic Leader**: Largest organic coffee producer globally (>25% of production organic)
- **Shade-Grown Champion**: Extensive agroforestry systems, biodiversity protection
- **Indigenous Heritage**: Many indigenous communities depend on coffee (Maya, Mixtec, Zapotec)
- **Fair Trade**: Strong cooperative structure, fair trade certifications common
- **Proximity**: Close to US market, fresh coffee readily available
- **Diversity**: Three distinct primary growing regions (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz)
- **Tradition**: Coffee cultivation since 1700s, rich cultural integration
- **Quality Potential**: High-altitude zones produce exceptional specialty coffee

**Historical Significance**:
- **1790s**: Coffee introduced to Veracruz from Caribbean
- **1800s**: Expansion to southern states (Chiapas, Oaxaca)
- **Early 1900s**: Became major producer
- **1973**: INMECAFE (Mexican Coffee Institute) created, supported smallholders
- **1989**: INMECAFE dissolved, price crisis followed
- **1990s-2000s**: Organic and fair trade movement emergence
- **2012-2014**: Coffee Rust (La Roya) epidemic, 40% production loss
- **Present**: Recovery, specialty focus, climate adaptation

**Current Challenges**:
- Coffee rust ongoing threat
- Climate change affecting growing zones
- Migration to US reducing labor force
- Price volatility, low farmgate prices
- Competition from Central/South American origins
- Aging farmer population

**Positive Trends**:
- Growing specialty recognition
- Organic and sustainability premiums
- Direct trade relationships increasing
