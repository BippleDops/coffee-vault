## 📋 Overview

Jamaica Blue Mountain is coffee's luxury enigma - a tiny Caribbean origin producing exceptionally mild, balanced, smooth coffee that commands astronomical prices ($50-100+/lb roasted) primarily from Japanese market dominance and legendary reputation, though specialty enthusiasts debate whether quality justifies stratospheric pricing.
