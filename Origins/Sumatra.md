## Unique Processing: Giling Basah

### Wet-Hulled Method

**Exclusive to Indonesia**:
- Unique processing method
- "Giling Basah" (wet hulling)
- Creates distinctive flavor
- Practical necessity

**Why It Developed**:
- High humidity (80-90%)
- Frequent rainfall
- Difficult drying conditions
- Farmers need quick payment

### Process Steps

**1. Pulping**:
- Remove cherry skin
- Leave mucilage on
- Similar to other methods initially

**2. Brief Fermentation**:
- 12-24 hours typically
- Partial fermentation
- Less than washed processing

**3. Partial Drying**:
- Dry to ~30-40% moisture
- Still very wet
- Parchment soft, pliable
- Critical difference

**4. Hulling (While Wet)**:
- Remove parchment at high moisture
- Exposes bean
- Distinct step
- Creates blue-green color

**5. Final Drying**:
- Dry naked beans to 12%
- Direct sun exposure
- Faster than parchment drying
- Creates unique characteristics

### Why It Creates Unique Flavor

**Chemical Effects**:
- Direct bean exposure during drying
- Different oxidation
- Unique fermentation profile
- Lipid oxidation differs

**Flavor Impact**:
- Earthy, herbal notes
- Full body
- Low acidity
- Complex, savory

## Flavor Characteristics

### Classic Sumatran Profile

**Typical Notes**:
- Earth, forest floor, mushroom
- Herbal (tobacco, cedar, sage)

- Very disease-resistant
- Cup quality variable
- Widely planted

**Why Hybrids**:
- Coffee Leaf Rust prevalence
- Rainfall and humidity ideal for disease
- Economic necessity
- Arabica not viable without resistance

### Heirloom Arabica (Rare)
