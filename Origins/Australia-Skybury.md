## 📋 Overview

Australian coffee is specialty coffee's expensive curiosity - boutique micro-production from Queensland's Atherton Tablelands delivering balanced, clean coffee at luxury pricing ($40-80/lb roasted) reflecting Australian labor costs, tourist appeal, and rarity rather than exceptional cup quality. Skybury Estate is most famous, representing Australian coffee ambition and agricultural innovation.

**Why Australian Coffee Exists**:

- **Price**: $40-80/12oz (tourism, labor, novelty premium)
- **Production**: Tiny (500-1,000 bags annually across all farms)
- **Value**: Debatable (supporting Australian agriculture vs. pure quality-price)
- **Availability**: Almost impossible to find outside Australia
