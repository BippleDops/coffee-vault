## 📋 Overview

Tanzania produces exceptional specialty coffee that rivals neighboring Kenya in complexity and brightness, yet remains relatively unknown and undervalued in the global market. With similar terroir (volcanic soil, high altitude, East African genetics), Tanzanian coffee delivers bright berry and citrus notes at significantly lower prices than Kenyan counterparts, making it one of specialty coffee's best-kept secrets.

**Why Tanzania Deserves Attention**:
- **Similar to Kenya**: Same volcanic terroir, altitude, processing methods
- **Lower Prices**: 30-50% cheaper than comparable Kenyan coffee
- **Quality**: 85-90+ cup scores achievable, competition-level
- **Bright Acidity**: Berry, citrus, wine-like (East African signature)
- **Clean Cup**: Washed processing excellence
- **Mount Kilimanjaro**: Famous coffee from Africa's highest mountain slopes
- **Peaberry**: Significant peaberry production (round beans, concentrated flavor)
- **Underrated**: Quality exceeds recognition and pricing

**Historical Background**:
- **1890s**: Coffee introduced by German colonists
- **1900s-1920s**: Expansion under German then British colonial rule
- **1920s**: Kent variety introduced from India (disease resistance)
- **Post-Independence** (1961): Government control, cooperatives dominate
- **1990s**: Liberalization, quality focus begins
- **2000s-Present**: Specialty emergence, still undervalued
- **Challenge**: Political instability, infrastructure limits growth
