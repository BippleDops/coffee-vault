- Similar to Sumatra
- Creates earthy-herbal character

**Washed** (30-40%, More than Sumatra):
- Higher altitude enables better washed processing
- Cleaner, brighter, more chocolate-forward
- Less extreme earthiness

**Result**: Sulawesi offers both profiles (choice vs. Sumatra's wet-hulled dominance)
