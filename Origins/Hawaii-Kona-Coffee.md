# Hawaii - Kona and Island Coffee Districts

## Overview

Hawaii is the only U.S. state that commercially produces coffee, cultivating high-quality Arabica in the volcanic soils of multiple islands. Hawaiian coffee, particularly Kona coffee from the Big Island, is among the world's most expensive and sought-after, commanding premium prices ($30-$80+/lb green) due to quality, scarcity, high production costs, and strong brand recognition. Beyond Kona, specialty coffee production has expanded to Ka'u (Big Island), Maui, Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai, each developing distinct regional identities and flavor profiles.

**Geographic Context**: The Hawaiian archipelago consists of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean, approximately 2,400 miles from the U.S. mainland. Coffee cultivation occurs on five main islands: Hawaii (Big Island), Maui, Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai. The volcanic slopes, tropical climate, afternoon cloud cover ("Kona cloud"), consistent trade winds, and rich soils create ideal growing conditions at relatively low elevations (150-900 MASL) compared to other specialty origins.

**Coffee History**: Coffee was introduced to Hawaii in 1825 by Chief Boki, governor of Oahu, who brought seedlings from Brazil. Commercial cultivation began in the 1830s-1840s, with Kona district emerging as the premier region by the 1850s. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw expansion of coffee plantations, initially with contract labor systems and later transitioning to family-owned smallholder farms. The "Kona" name became protected by trademark and Federal and State regulations. The late 20th century brought challenges from global commodity markets, but the specialty coffee movement of the 1990s-2000s revitalized Hawaiian coffee through quality focus, direct marketing, and agritourism. The 21st century has seen expansion to Ka'u, Maui, and other districts, diversification of varieties (including Geisha introductions), and processing experimentation.

**Current Production Statistics**:
- Annual production: 3,500-4,500 metric tons total (all Hawaiian islands)
- Kona coffee: ~1,000-1,200 metric tons (~40-50 bags per farm average)
- Ka'u coffee: ~400-600 metric tons
- Maui, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai: ~500-800 metric tons combined
- Cultivated area: ~3,000-3,500 hectares total
- Number of farms: approximately 800-900 (Kona ~650, others ~250)
- Average farm size: 2-4 hectares (5-10 acres) - small by global standards
- Domestic consumption: 70-80% (U.S. mainland market primarily)
- Export: 20-30% (Japan, specialty markets)
- Production challenges: High labor costs, competition from cheaper imports, coffee berry borer (invasive pest since 2010)
