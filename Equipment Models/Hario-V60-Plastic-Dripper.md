## 📝 Notes

### Historical Context

**V60 Origin Story**:
- Designed: 2005 by Hario engineers
- Inspiration: Perfect extraction through geometry
- 60-degree angle: Optimal for water flow and contact time
- Spiral ribs: Allow air escape, prevent filter collapse
- Single hole: Maximum brewer control over flow rate
- Launch: Quiet at first, grew through word-of-mouth

**Rise to Prominence**:
- 2008-2010: Adopted by third-wave coffee shops
- 2010s: Became industry standard for filter coffee
- World Barista Championships: V60 used in competitions
- Specialty coffee: V60 synonymous with pour-over excellence
- Current status: Iconic, timeless, industry standard

**Cultural Impact**:
- Defined pour-over coffee culture
- Spawned countless imitators
- Inspired generations of coffee enthusiasts
- Proved simple design can be revolutionary
- $8 proves price ≠ quality

### Design Analysis

**60-Degree Cone**:
- Extends water contact time with coffee
- Creates optimal extraction path
- Allows even saturation
- Deeper than most drippers (more surface area)

**Spiral Ribs**:
- Allow air to escape during brewing
- Prevent filter from sticking to walls
- Create space for water flow
- Enable faster drainage when desired

**Single Large Hole**:
- Gives brewer complete control over flow rate
- Faster drainage than multi-hole designs
- Requires technique (not beginner-friendly)
- Rewards skill and practice

**Plastic vs Other Materials**:
- **Plastic**: Lightweight, durable, affordable, minimal heat retention
- **Ceramic**: Heat retention, aesthetic, heavier, fragile
- **Glass**: Beautiful, heat-resistant, fragile, mid-weight
- **Metal**: Durable, heat-conducting, premium, expensive
- **Copper**: Heat-conducting, beautiful, very expensive

**Performance**: All materials produce equivalent coffee (blind taste tests confirm)
**Recommendation**: Plastic for value and practicality, ceramic/glass/metal for aesthetics

### Usage Techniques

**Basic V60 Technique**:
1. Rinse filter with hot water (preheat and remove paper taste)
2. Add coffee grounds (medium-fine grind)
3. Create well in center (optional, helps bloom)
4. Start timer, pour bloom water (2x coffee weight)
5. Wait 30-45 seconds (bloom)
6. Pour remaining water in stages or continuously
7. Target total time: 2:30-3:30 (varies by recipe)
8. Enjoy clean, complex cup

**Common Mistakes**:
1. Grind too coarse (under-extraction, sour, weak)
2. Grind too fine (over-extraction, bitter, astringent)
3. Water too hot (>96°C can scald)
4. Water too cool (<88°C under-extracts)
5. Uneven pouring (channeling, uneven extraction)
6. Too fast (under-extracted)
7. Too slow (over-extracted)
8. Not rinsing filter (papery taste)
9. Wrong coffee dose (weak or strong)
10. Old coffee (stale, flat flavor)

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Sour/under-extracted**: Grind finer, use hotter water, pour slower
- **Bitter/over-extracted**: Grind coarser, use cooler water, pour faster
- **Weak**: More coffee, grind finer, slower pour
- **Too strong**: Less coffee, grind coarser, faster pour
- **Astringent**: Lower water temp, grind coarser
- **Flat**: Fresher beans, check grind uniformity

## 💭 Personal Assessment

### Overall Impression

The Hario V60 plastic dripper is, without exaggeration, one of the most important pieces of coffee equipment ever designed. At $8, it delivers professional-quality pour-over brewing. The design is so elegant that it hasn't changed in 20 years—it doesn't need to. The plastic version performs identically to versions costing 10x more. This is the best value in all of coffee equipment.

What makes the V60 special isn't complexity or premium materials—it's the perfection of simple geometry. The 60-degree cone, spiral ribs, and single hole create optimal conditions for extraction. The design gives skilled brewers complete control while remaining accessible to beginners willing to practice. It's democratic: anyone can afford it, and everyone can learn it.

The plastic version is the best version for most people. It's lightweight (perfect for travel), durable (won't shatter when dropped), and performs identically to ceramic or glass in blind taste tests. The only advantage of premium materials is aesthetics and heat retention (minimal practical impact). For $8, you get decades of professional-quality brewing.

### Strengths

**Unbeatable Value**: $8 for professional-quality brewing is absurd. Nothing in coffee—or perhaps any hobby—offers this cost-to-performance ratio.

**Proven Design**: 20 years of dominance in specialty coffee. Used by world champions, third-wave cafes, and home enthusiasts. The design simply works.

**Complete Control**: The single-hole design gives brewers total control over extraction. Pour fast or slow, agitate or not—you decide. This control enables learning and mastery.

**Simplicity**: No moving parts, no complexity. It's a piece of plastic with precise geometry. This simplicity means nothing breaks and nothing goes wrong.

**Durability**: Plastic doesn't shatter, crack, or wear out. Drop it, pack it in luggage, use it daily for years—it endures.

**Universality**: Available everywhere, works with widely-available filters, compatible with any setup. No proprietary anything.

**Results**: Produces exceptional coffee when technique is good. Clarity, complexity, clean cups—the V60 reveals what coffee can be.

### Weaknesses

**Learning Curve**: The V60 rewards technique but punishes mistakes. Beginners may struggle with consistency. The Kalita Wave or Clever Dripper are more forgiving.

**Requires Technique**: You can't just pour water and walk away. Pour rate, pattern, water temperature all matter. This is feature for enthusiasts, bug for casual users.

**Minimal Heat Retention** (Plastic): Plastic doesn't retain heat like ceramic. In cold environments, this can cool the brew. Solution: preheat everything, use hot water rinse.

**Aesthetics**: Plastic feels cheap compared to ceramic, glass, or copper. For those who value countertop beauty, premium materials might be worth the cost (though they don't brew better).

**Filter Cost**: Ongoing expense. At $0.08-0.10 per brew, filters add up. Reusable metal filters exist but change flavor profile.

### Best Use Cases

**Ideal For**:
- Anyone learning pour-over (best learning tool)
- Home enthusiasts (professional quality at home)
- Travel (lightweight, durable, compact)
- Budget-conscious users (best value)
- Professional tasting/cupping (industry standard)
- Single-cup brewing (perfect for 1-2 cups)
- Learning to taste coffee (clarity reveals nuances)

**Not Ideal For**:
- Absolute beginners wanting foolproof results (get Clever Dripper)
- Large batches regularly (get Chemex or V60 Size 03)
- Aesthetics-focused users (get ceramic, glass, or copper version)
- No-technique brewing (get Clever Dripper or AeroPress)

### Final Recommendation

**Overall Rating**: 10/10 (for pour-over brewing)

**Universal Recommendation**: Every coffee enthusiast should own a V60. At $8, there's no reason not to. Even if you prefer other methods, the V60 is essential for learning, experimenting, and understanding pour-over coffee.

**Bottom Line**: The Hario V60 plastic dripper is the best value in coffee equipment and one of the most important coffee innovations of the 21st century. For the price of a latte, you get professional-quality pour-over brewing for decades. The design is timeless, the results are exceptional, and the value is unmatched.

Buy the plastic version. Learn to use it properly (watch James Hoffmann's video). Practice. Within weeks, you'll be making coffee that rivals the best cafes. Within months, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

**Would I buy it again?** Already own three (Size 01, 02, 03).
**Would I recommend it?** To literally everyone interested in coffee.
**Best purchase in coffee?** Yes. $8 for decades of excellence.
