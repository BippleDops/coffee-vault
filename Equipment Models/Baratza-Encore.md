## 🔍 Technical Details & Deep Dive

### Grinding Mechanism Explained

**Burr Geometry & Cutting Action**:
- **Burr type**: Conical (cone inside ring)
- **Outer burr**: Stationary (attached to adjustment collar)
- **Inner burr**: Rotating (motor-driven, 450 RPM)
- **Bean entry**: Top (gravity feed from hopper)
- **Bean path**: Spirals down between burrs
- **Cutting stages**: 3-stage reduction (large → medium → final size)
- **Exit**: Centrifugal force + gravity (expelled downward)

**Adjustment Mechanism**:
- **Method**: Twist outer burr carrier
- **Clicks**: 40 distinct positions
- **Detent mechanism**: Metal ball + spring (positive click feel)
- **Numbering**: Molded into plastic (1-40)
- **Direction**: Clockwise = coarser (burrs farther apart)
- **Precision**: ~50-75 microns per click (approximate)
- **Repeatability**: Excellent (return to same setting accurately)

**Bean Feeding System**:
- **Hopper design**: Conical (funnels beans to center)
- **Feed chute**: Wide (minimal bridging)
- **Gravity-fed**: No auger or pusher
- **Bean flow**: Consistent (rarely stops)
- **Popcorning**: Minimal (good burr vacuum effect)
- **Last beans**: Some retention in chute (normal)

**Grind Path & Retention**:
- **Path**: Hopper → chute → burrs → exit chute → bin
- **Retention points**: Burr chamber (~0.3g), exit chute (~0.5g)
- **Static retention**: Grounds bin sides (~0.5-1g, varies)
- **Total retention**: 0.5-1.5g typical
- **Purging**: Grind extra 1-2g to clear previous setting
- **Exchange rate**: ~95-97% output per input

### Maintenance & Care

**Daily Maintenance**:
- Empty grounds bin after each use
- Tap bin on counter (release static-stuck grounds)
- Wipe exterior with dry cloth (remove dust)
- Empty hopper if not using for 2+ days (keep beans fresh)
- Quick brush of burrs (optional, if visible grounds)

**Weekly Maintenance**:
- Remove hopper and grounds bin
- Brush out burr chamber (included brush or soft toothbrush)
- Wipe burrs with dry cloth (don't wash burrs)
- Clean grounds bin (wash with soap and water)
- Check for unusual sounds or vibrations

**Monthly Maintenance**:
- Deep burr cleaning (remove accumulated oils)
- Grind 20-30g of rice or Grindz tablets (optional, debated)
- OR: Disassemble burrs, brush thoroughly (preferred method)
- Clean grounds bin (wash in warm soapy water)
- Check power cable for damage
- Inspect feet and housing for cracks

**Burr Cleaning Methods**:
**Method 1 - Grindz Tablets**:
- Baratza-approved method
- Run 1 capful (35g) through grinder at medium setting
- Discard ground tablets
- Run 20g of coffee to purge tablet residue
- Easy, quick (5 minutes)

**Method 2 - Rice** (controversial):
- Some users swear by it (cheap, effective)
- Some experts warn against it (too hard, can damage burrs)
- Baratza says: "Not recommended but won't void warranty"
- White rice, 20-30g, medium setting
- Purge well with coffee after (40-60g)

**Method 3 - Manual Disassembly** (best method):
- Remove hopper (twist counterclockwise)
- Remove upper burr (3 screws, lift out)
- Brush both burrs thoroughly
- Wipe with dry cloth (never water on burrs)
- Reassemble (10-15 minutes total)
- No purge needed (best cleaning)

**Annual Maintenance**:
- Full disassembly and cleaning
- Inspect all parts for wear
- Check burr wear (look for flat spots, dullness)
- Consider burr replacement if 500+ lbs ground
- Check switch operation (most common wear item)
- Lubricate adjustment collar (tiny amount of food-grade lube)

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**:

**Problem: Grinder won't turn on**
- Check: Power cable plugged in
- Check: Wall outlet working (test with another device)
- Check: Hopper properly seated (some units have safety switch)
- Solution: Test power switch continuity (may need replacement)

**Problem: Inconsistent grind**
- Check: Burrs aligned (wiggle inner burr, should be minimal play)
- Check: Burr wear (500+ lbs? Time for replacement)
- Check: Setting stability (clicks firm and positive?)
- Solution: Replace burrs ($35-45)

**Problem: Loud grinding noise**
- Check: Foreign object in burrs (stone, unroasted bean)
- Check: Burrs touching (set to finest, should just touch without grinding sound)
- Solution: Remove object, realign burrs if necessary

**Problem: Grounds everywhere (static)**
- Check: Humidity (low humidity = more static)
- Solution 1: RDT (Ross Droplet Technique - spray beans lightly)
- Solution 2: Use grounds bin lid (captures static grounds)
- Solution 3: Tap bin on counter after grinding
- Solution 4: Ground into cup with lid (bypass bin)

**Problem: Motor runs but beans not grinding**
- Check: Burr carrier secured (screws tight)
- Check: Inner burr attached to motor shaft
- Solution: Disassemble, reattach burrs, tighten screws

### Advanced Modifications & Hacks

**Shim Mod** (for finer espresso grinding):
- **What**: Add thin metal shim to burr carrier
- **Effect**: Decreases minimum burr gap (finer grinding)
- **Materials**: 0.1-0.5mm metal shims (washers, feeler gauges)
- **Process**: Place shim under outer burr carrier, reassemble
- **Result**: Settings 1-8 become espresso-capable
- **Tradeoff**: Loses coarsest settings (acceptable for espresso users)
- **Warranty**: Voids warranty (reversible though)
- **Difficulty**: Easy (15 minutes, basic tools)

**M2 Burr Upgrade**:
- **What**: Replacement burrs with improved geometry
- **Cost**: $35-45 from Baratza
- **Effect**: Better clarity, slightly finer capability
- **Installation**: 10 minutes, no tools except screwdriver
- **Improvement**: Subtle (5-10% better cup quality)
- **Worth it**: If replacing worn burrs anyway (yes), otherwise (maybe)

**Single-Dose Hopper Mod**:
- **Problem**: Stock hopper retains beans, holds too many for single-dosing
- **Solution 1**: 3D-printed low-retention hopper (Etsy, eBay)
- **Solution 2**: Remove hopper, dose directly into top
- **Solution 3**: Custom funnel + hopper removal
- **Effect**: Near-zero retention (0.1-0.3g)
- **Tradeoff**: Less convenient for batch grinding

**Anti-Static Mods**:
- **RDT (Ross Droplet Technique)**: Spray beans with mist of water before grinding
- **Grounds bin mod**: Aluminum foil lining (DIY Faraday cage)
- **Grounding wire**: Attach wire to burr carrier (ground static)
- **Dosing cup**: Grind directly into metal cup (bypasses plastic bin)

**Switch Upgrade**:
- **Problem**: Stock switch wears out (3-7 years heavy use)
- **Solution**: Replace with higher-quality momentary switch
- **Cost**: $5-15 for better switch
- **Effect**: Longer lifespan, better tactile feel
- **Difficulty**: Easy (15 minutes, basic soldering)

## 📝 Expert Tips & Tricks

### Getting the Most from Your Encore

**Dialing In Filter Coffee**:
1. Start at manufacturer recommendation (V60 = setting 18)
2. Brew, taste, note brew time
3. If too slow/bitter: Go coarser by 2 clicks
4. If too fast/sour: Go finer by 2 clicks
5. Repeat until sweet, balanced, clear
6. Remember your number (write it down!)

**Reducing Retention**:
- Single-dose into hopper (only grind what you need)
- Tap grinder sides during grinding (dislodge stuck grounds)
- Remove grounds bin, shake grinder (final grounds fall out)
- Monthly cleaning (prevents buildup)

**Minimizing Static**:
- **RDT**: Spray beans with single spritz of water (mist, not soak)
- Grind into metal vessel (stainless cup, not plastic bin)
- Use grounds bin lid (traps static grounds)
- Tap bin on counter after grinding (releases stuck grounds)
- Humid environment helps (run humidifier in winter)

**Extending Burr Life**:
- Avoid oily beans (can gum up burrs, requires frequent cleaning)
- Monthly cleaning (prevent oil accumulation)
- Don't grind with empty burrs (no beans = metal-on-metal wear)
- Appropriate grind size (don't force ultra-fine, stresses burrs)
- Quality beans (avoid rocks, sticks, debris)

**Consistent Workflow**:
1. Weigh beans (18g for single cup)
2. Quick RDT (optional, one spray)
3. Pour into hopper
4. Set grind size (18 for V60)
5. Press button, hold for ~20 seconds
6. Release, tap bin, pour into brewer
7. Quick brush of burrs (if visible grounds)

### Troubleshooting Flavor

**Bitter, Harsh Cup**:
- **Cause**: Over-extraction (too fine, too long)
- **Solution**: Go 2-3 clicks coarser
- **Or**: Reduce brew time (faster pour, hotter water)

**Sour, Weak Cup**:
- **Cause**: Under-extraction (too coarse, too short)
- **Solution**: Go 2-3 clicks finer
- **Or**: Increase brew time (slower pour, cooler water)

**Muddy, Unclear Cup**:
- **Cause**: Too many fines (over-extraction of small particles)
- **Solution**: Go 1-2 clicks coarser (reduce fines impact)
- **Or**: Cleaner brewing (Chemex filter, paper filter improvement)
- **Or**: Clean burrs (old oils = off flavors)

**Inconsistent Cups Day-to-Day**:
- **Cause 1**: Different bean amounts (dose inconsistency)
  - **Solution**: Weigh beans every time (use scale)
- **Cause 2**: Setting drift (adjustment collar moved)
  - **Solution**: Check setting before each grind
- **Cause 3**: Burr wear (500+ lbs ground)
  - **Solution**: Replace burrs ($40)

**Astringent, Papery Taste**:
- **Cause**: Fines over-extracting, or dirty burrs
- **Solution 1**: Clean burrs thoroughly
- **Solution 2**: Go slightly coarser (1-2 clicks)
- **Solution 3**: Rinse paper filter before brewing

### Advanced Techniques

**Dialing In by Brew Time** (V60 example):
- **Target brew time**: 2:30-3:00 for 18g dose
- **If 2:00 or faster**: Grind finer (1-2 clicks)
- **If 3:30 or slower**: Grind coarser (1-2 clicks)
- **Repeat**: Until target time + good flavor achieved

**Temperature + Grind Interaction**:
- **Hotter water** (95-96°C): Can use slightly coarser grind (more extraction from heat)
- **Cooler water** (88-90°C): May need finer grind (less extraction, compensate with surface area)
- **Encore advantage**: Easy to adjust grind to compensate for temp changes

**Bean Age Compensation**:
- **Fresh beans** (3-14 days off roast): May need slightly coarser (CO2 creates resistance)
- **Older beans** (30+ days): May need slightly finer (degassing complete, less resistance)
- **Encore**: Quick adjustment accommodates bean aging

**Seasonal Adjustments**:
- **Winter** (dry, low humidity): More static, grind may seem finer (compaction)
- **Summer** (humid): Less static, grind may seem coarser
- **Solution**: Adjust by 1-2 clicks seasonally, use RDT in winter
