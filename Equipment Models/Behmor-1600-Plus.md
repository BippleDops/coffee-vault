# Behmor 1600 Plus Home Coffee Roaster

## Overview

The Behmor 1600 Plus represents the most accessible entry point into home coffee roasting, offering drum roasting capability, smoke suppression technology, and one-pound batch capacity at the remarkably approachable price of $400. Released in 2015 as an evolution of the original Behmor 1600, the Plus model improved upon its predecessor with enhanced smoke suppression, better temperature control, and refined user interface while maintaining the accessibility that made Behmor the best-selling home roaster in North America.

Home coffee roasting appeals to enthusiasts seeking ultimate freshness, cost savings on specialty coffee, and creative control over roast profiles. The Behmor 1600 Plus makes this pursuit practical for home environments through its afterburner smoke suppression system that dramatically reduces the smoke and aroma that make roasting challenging in residential settings. This technological enabler allows apartment dwellers and suburban homeowners to roast without setting off smoke alarms or annoying neighbors.

At $400, the 1600 Plus positions itself as serious equipment for committed enthusiasts while remaining accessible to curious beginners willing to invest in the roasting journey. The one-pound capacity enables roasting enough coffee for 1-2 weeks of consumption in a single 15-25 minute session, making the time investment reasonable for regular roasters. The machine's semi-automatic operation balances convenience with control, offering five pre-programmed profiles plus manual override for experienced roasters developing custom profiles.

The Behmor bridges the gap between popcorn popper experimental roasting and expensive commercial-grade home roasters costing $1,500-3,000+. It delivers genuine drum roasting with adequate capacity and control for serious home use without requiring the financial commitment or technical expertise of prosumer equipment. This positioning has made it the default recommendation for home roasting entry, with tens of thousands of units sold and an active community sharing techniques, modifications, and support.

## Basic Information

### Company Background

Behmor Inc., founded in 2003 by Joe Behm in Southern California, emerged from personal frustration with available home roasting options. Joe Behm, a coffee enthusiast and tinkerer, wanted to roast coffee at home but found existing options inadequate—popcorn poppers and heat gun methods produced small batches inconsistently, while expensive commercial equipment exceeded home user budgets and produced excessive smoke for residential use.

Behm's engineering background led him to develop a drum roaster incorporating an afterburner to address the smoke problem. The afterburner concept, borrowed from industrial applications, uses a secondary heating element to combust smoke particles before they exit the machine. This innovation transformed home roasting viability, making indoor roasting practical without elaborate ventilation systems.

The original Behmor 1600, released in 2005, became the first home roaster to combine meaningful capacity (one pound), effective smoke suppression, and accessible pricing (initially $299, later $400 with improvements). The product found immediate market acceptance among specialty coffee enthusiasts frustrated by limited home roasting options or paying premium prices for freshly roasted specialty coffee.

Behmor operates as a small company focused exclusively on home coffee roasting equipment. This specialization allows deep expertise in the specific challenges of residential roasting—smoke control, safety, capacity optimization, and user interface design for non-commercial operators. The company maintains direct customer relationships through their website, email support, and active participation in home roasting forums.

The 1600 Plus model, introduced in 2015, represented a significant evolution incorporating ten years of user feedback and field experience. Improvements included enhanced smoke suppression, better temperature control, a more intuitive control panel, improved chaff collection, and refined roast profiles. These changes addressed the most common user complaints while maintaining the core value proposition of accessible home roasting.

Manufacturing occurs in Taiwan to Behmor specifications, with quality control and final testing performed before shipping. This approach balances cost control with quality standards, enabling the $400 price point while maintaining reliability acceptable for home use.

Behmor's market position focuses entirely on home roasting enthusiasts rather than commercial cafe applications. The company provides extensive educational resources about roasting fundamentals, green coffee sourcing, profile development, and troubleshooting. This educational approach reflects understanding that successful home roasting requires knowledge as well as equipment.

Customer support operates through email and phone channels, with response times typically within 24-48 hours. The company maintains a replacement parts inventory for common wear items and provides troubleshooting guidance for extending equipment lifespan. Warranty service handles manufacturing defects, though many issues can be resolved through user-serviceable maintenance.

### Product Development and Design Philosophy

The Behmor 1600 Plus design prioritizes safety, smoke control, and user accessibility over maximum performance or professional-grade features. This philosophy recognizes that home roasting must integrate into residential environments with constraints different from commercial roasting operations.

**Smoke Suppression Technology:**

The afterburner represents the Behmor's defining innovation. During roasting, coffee releases smoke from caramelization, Maillard reactions, and chaff burning. This smoke contains volatile organic compounds that create strong aroma and visible smoke that trigger alarms and complaints in home settings.

The Behmor's afterburner uses a heating element reaching temperatures around 500-600°F positioned in the exhaust path. Smoke passes through this heated chamber where volatile compounds combust, converting smoke into CO2 and water vapor. This dramatically reduces visible smoke and odor intensity compared to roasting without afterburner systems.

The system isn't perfect—some smoke and aroma escape, particularly during first crack when volatile production peaks. Adequate ventilation (kitchen exhaust hood or open window) remains necessary but far less critical than without afterburner. The smoke suppression enables roasting in apartments and homes where traditional roasting would be impractical or prohibited.

**Drum Roasting Mechanism:**

The Behmor uses a stainless steel rotating drum driven by an electric motor. Beans tumble as the drum rotates, providing relatively even heat exposure compared to fluid bed or stationary roasting methods. The drum diameter and rotation speed represent optimization for batch size and roast time balance.

Heating occurs through infrared heating elements positioned around the drum. This provides radiant heat transfer to bean surfaces while the drum rotation promotes conduction through bean contact with heated drum walls. The combination produces roast development characteristics similar to commercial drum roasters, though heating power limitations affect achievable profiles.

**Capacity and Batch Sizing:**

The one-pound maximum capacity allows meaningful production for home use—enough coffee for 5-10 days of consumption for moderate coffee drinkers. The machine also handles smaller batches (quarter-pound to half-pound) with profile adjustments, enabling roast experimentation without committing to full-pound batches.

Minimum batch size recommendations around 100-125 grams prevent damage from insufficient thermal mass. Very small batches don't absorb heat adequately, potentially causing temperature runaway or uneven roasting. The 100-450 gram range provides flexibility while maintaining roast quality.

**Control System:**

The 1600 Plus features electronic control with five pre-programmed profiles (labeled P1-P5) offering different time and temperature combinations. P1-P3 target progressively darker roasts, while P4-P5 provide extended time for slower development. Manual mode (labeled "D") allows experienced users to control heating element power and time independently.

A digital display shows elapsed time and temperature (estimated, not precisely calibrated). Controls include start/stop, profile selection, time adjustment, and cooling cycle activation. The interface aims for accessibility rather than precision, suitable for home users learning roasting without overwhelming complexity.

**Safety Features:**

Multiple safety systems protect users and prevent fire hazards:
- Automatic shutoff after maximum time (prevents forgetting active roast)
- Thermal cutoff if internal temperature exceeds safe limits
- Chaff collector reduces fire risk from chaff accumulation
- Cool-down cycle with air circulation after roast completion
- Door safety lock prevents opening during active roast
- Stable base design minimizes tip-over risk

**Cooling System:**

After roasting completes, the Behmor activates cooling mode using fans to draw air through the drum and exhaust hot air. This active cooling brings beans from 400-450°F roasting temperature down to near-ambient temperature over 8-12 minutes. The cooling system prevents over-roasting from residual heat and makes beans safe to handle and package.

## Notes

### Research Notes

The Behmor 1600 Plus occupies a unique position as the enabling technology for residential home roasting. Before affordable smoke suppression, home roasting remained marginal—popcorn poppers and heat guns produced tiny batches inconsistently, while lack of smoke control relegated roasting to outdoors or garages. The Behmor's afterburner innovation transformed viability, making kitchen roasting practical for apartment dwellers and suburban homeowners.

The $400 price point positions perfectly at the intersection of accessibility and capability. Cheaper than prosumer equipment requiring $1,000-3,000 investment, yet substantial enough to handle regular weekly roasting producing meaningful quantities. For specialty coffee enthusiasts spending $75-150/month on roasted coffee, the 4-6 month payback period makes financial sense while enabling freshness and quality control impossible with purchased coffee.

The learning curve proves steeper than marketing suggests but not insurmountable. Expect 10-20 roasts before achieving consistent, satisfying results. Understanding first crack timing, development time concepts, and each profile's characteristics takes experimentation. The pre-programmed profiles help beginners but aren't automatically perfect—adjustments become necessary as knowledge develops.

Durability concerns appear valid based on user reports. Heating elements have finite lifespans, with replacement often needed after 2-5 years of regular use. The $60-80 replacement cost is manageable but should be budgeted as expected maintenance rather than surprise failure. Electronics also fail occasionally, though less predictably than heating elements.

The one-pound capacity proves ideal for home roasting frequency. Most home roasters consume 0.5-1.5 pounds weekly, so weekly roasting sessions produce adequate supply without excessive time commitment. Smaller capacity roasters (quarter-pound to half-pound) require more frequent roasting sessions that become burdensome. The Behmor's capacity enables sustainable roasting rhythm.

Smoke suppression effectiveness depends on roast level and ventilation expectations. Light to medium roasts produce manageable smoke with kitchen exhaust hood alone. Dark roasts approaching second crack produce significant smoke requiring strong ventilation even with afterburner. Users sensitive to smoke or living in apartments with inadequate ventilation should expect some smoke management challenges, though still far better than roasting without afterburner.

### Technical Notes

**Profile Optimization:**

Pre-programmed profiles provide starting points but benefit from customization:

P1 (Light Roast): Best for high-altitude, dense beans. Often finishes just past first crack. Good for preserving origin character and acidity.

P2 (Medium Roast): Versatile profile suitable for most origins. Typically reaches end of first crack or just into development. Balanced sweetness and acidity.

P3 (Full City): Darker profile reaching into or through second crack. Works for espresso roasting and darker preferences.

P4/P5 (Extended): Longer time profiles for slower development or larger batches needing more time.

Manual Mode (D): Allows complete control over time and temperature. Experienced roasters develop custom profiles optimized for specific beans and desired results.

**Batch Size Effects:**

Smaller batches (125-225g):
- Heat faster, reach first crack earlier
- May need reduced time or temperature
- More prone to uneven roasting (insufficient thermal mass)

Medium batches (250-350g):
- Most consistent roasting performance
- Good thermal mass for even development
- Profiles work well without major adjustments

Large batches (375-454g):
- Slower heating, longer to first crack
- May need extended time or higher temperature
- More forgiving of technique variations (larger thermal mass)

**First Crack and Development:**

First crack typically occurs 10-15 minutes into roast. Listen for popping sounds (like popcorn) indicating bean structure breaking as internal pressure releases.

Development time (time after first crack) determines roast level:
- 0-1 minutes: Light roast (City, New England)
- 1-2.5 minutes: Medium roast (City+, Full City)
- 2.5-4+ minutes: Dark roast (approaching or into second crack)

Second crack (if reached) sounds different—sharper, more rapid popping. Indicates sugars carbonizing and oils migrating. Typically 14-20 minutes into roast if reached at all.

**Cooling Optimization:**

The integrated cooling system works but can be enhanced:
- After cooling cycle completes, transfer beans to external cooling tray if available
- Air circulation speeds cooling and prevents over-roasting from residual heat
- Completely cool beans (8-12 hours) before packaging for optimal flavor development

### Known Issues

**Heating Element Degradation:**
Most common long-term issue. Elements weaken over time, manifesting as slower roasts, difficulty reaching temperature, or inability to complete profiles. Replacement requires disassembly and costs $60-80 for parts. User-serviceable with tutorial videos available.

**Temperature Display Inaccuracy:**
The displayed temperature is estimated rather than precisely measured. Actual bean temperature may vary ±15-25°F from display. Learn to roast by sight, sound, and smell rather than relying solely on temperature reading.

**Uneven Roasting:**
Some beans may roast lighter or darker than others in same batch. Causes include uneven bean size (sort before roasting), insufficient drum rotation, or uneven heat distribution. Improved by using consistent bean sizes and optimal batch sizes (250-350g).

**Chaff Buildup:**
Chaff (coffee bean skin) accumulates in collector and drum. Excessive chaff buildup can catch fire. Clean chaff collector after each roast and deep-clean drum every 10-20 roasts.

**Glass Window Smoke Staining:**
Over time, smoke residue can stain glass window reducing visibility. Clean with vinegar solution or specialized glass cleaner periodically.

**Door Seal Degradation:**
Rubber door seal can degrade over time, causing smoke leakage during roasting. Replacement seals available for ~$20 and user-replaceable.

### Personal Assessment

The Behmor 1600 Plus successfully fulfills its mission as accessible entry into home roasting. For enthusiasts willing to invest $400 and learn roasting fundamentals, it enables coffee freshness and quality control impossible through purchasing roasted coffee. The smoke suppression technology specifically makes residential roasting practical for apartment dwellers and homeowners who couldn't roast otherwise.

Realistic expectations are critical. This is not commercial-grade equipment producing professionally consistent results automatically. It requires learning, experimentation, and technique development over 10-20 roasts before achieving satisfying consistency. Users expecting immediate perfection will be disappointed.

The one-pound capacity proves ideal for regular home roasting—enough production to make weekly roasting sustainable without excessive time commitment. The drum roasting method produces familiar flavor profiles and proves more forgiving for beginners than fluid bed alternatives.

Durability concerns are valid. Budget for heating element replacement as expected maintenance after 2-5 years rather than surprise failure. The $60-80 repair cost is reasonable as part of ownership but should be anticipated.

For specialty coffee enthusiasts spending $75+/month on roasted coffee, the financial case is compelling. Four to six months of roasting recoups the $400 investment through green coffee savings while providing superior freshness. The quality and freshness improvements justify the time investment for enthusiasts valuing ultimate coffee quality.

**Personal Rating: 7.5/10**

**Breakdown:**
- Smoke Suppression: 8/10 (works adequately for residential use)
- Capacity: 9/10 (one pound ideal for home roasting)
- Ease of Use: 7/10 (learning curve but achievable)
- Build Quality: 6/10 (adequate but maintenance expected)
- Value: 8/10 (justified for regular specialty coffee consumers)
- Roast Quality: 7/10 (good results achievable with learning)

**Recommendation:** Highly recommended for enthusiasts willing to invest time learning roasting and committed to regular (weekly or more) roasting. Not recommended for casual interest or those expecting immediate professional results.
