## ⚠️ Limitations & Drawbacks

### Key Weaknesses

**Grinding Speed** (vs Electric):
- 45-60 seconds for 18g (vs 3-5 sec electric)
- 3-4 shots/day: 3-4 minutes grinding total (vs <30 seconds electric)
- High-volume: Tedious (5+ shots/day manual grinding exhausting)
- Comparison: 1Zpresso JX-Pro faster (30-40 sec for 18g)

**Physical Effort Required**:
- 48mm burrs: Moderate resistance (requires decent arm strength)
- Light roasts: Harder to grind (denser beans)
- Fine espresso: More effort than coarse pour-over
- Not suitable: Those with limited arm strength, arthritis, injury
- Comparison: Conical hand grinders easier (less surface area)

**Stepless Adjustment Learning Curve**:
- No click-stops: Harder to remember exact setting
- Dialing-in: Requires note-taking or memory
- Numbered dial: Helps but not as intuitive as click-stop
- Comparison: Comandante click-stop easier for beginners
- Workaround: Written notes, photo of dial setting

**Catch Cup Static**:
- Plastic cup: Moderate static (grounds cling)
- RDT required: Ross Droplet Technique essential
- Messy without RDT: Grounds stick to cup sides
- Transfer needed: Can't grind directly into portafilter (some grinders can)
- Cleanup: Tap cup, brush grounds into portafilter

**Not Ideal for Filter Coffee**:
- Grind range: Espresso to fine filter (100-400 microns)
- Coarse settings: Outside sweet spot (French press challenging)
- Burr geometry: Espresso-optimized (not multi-purpose)
- Better alternatives: Comandante C40 (filter-focused), Lido 3 (filter model)
- Recommendation: Buy Lido ET for espresso, different grinder for filter

**Limited Availability**:
- Small-batch production: Occasional stock-outs
- Direct sales primary: Orphanespresso.com (limited retail)
- International shipping: Expensive, delays
- Used market: Good but smaller pool than mass-market grinders

**Hardened Steel Burrs** (Not Stainless):
- Rust risk: If exposed to moisture (rare but possible)
- Care required: Keep dry, don't wash burrs with water
- Comparison: Stainless burrs (some grinders) rust-proof
- Mitigation: Easy to maintain (just keep dry)

**Aesthetics** (Utilitarian):
- Industrial look: Functional vs luxurious (Kinu M47 prettier)
- Plastic catch cup: Not premium feel
- Finish quality: Good but not jewelry-grade
- Appeal: Function-first users only (not Instagram-worthy)

**No Grind-by-Weight**:
- Catch cup: Must weigh before grinding (separate scale needed)
- Workflow: Weigh beans → pour in grinder → grind → collect
- Retention: ~0.2g (minor loss, grind slightly more)
- Comparison: Some grinders integrate scales (rare, expensive)

**Bean Capacity**:
- 50-60g max: Sufficient for 2-3 double shots
- Large doses: Tedious (20g+ requires multiple grinds or careful loading)

- Compressed air: Blow out particles (outdoors, messy)
- Water: NEVER (hardened steel rusts, not stainless)
- Dry cloth: Wipe burrs if needed (dry only)

**Zero-Point Calibration**:
- When needed: After full disassembly, adjustment drift
- Method: Adjust until burrs chirp (just touching), back off 1/4 turn
- Mark zero: Note position on dial (reference point)
