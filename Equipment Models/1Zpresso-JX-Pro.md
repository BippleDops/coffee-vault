# 1Zpresso JX-Pro Manual Coffee Grinder

## Overview

The 1Zpresso JX-Pro represents exceptional value in manual coffee grinding, delivering espresso-capable performance with 48mm conical burrs at the remarkably accessible price of $159. Released in 2019 as an evolution of the original JX model, the JX-Pro added finer grinding capability and improved adjustment precision specifically for espresso enthusiasts seeking manual grinding quality without the $250-300 investment of premium hand grinders like the [[Comandante-C40-MK4]].

The JX-Pro's 48mm hardened stainless steel burrs are notably larger than the Comandante's 38mm burrs, providing theoretical advantages in grind uniformity and speed. The 200-click stepless adjustment system offers 12.5-micron precision per click, enabling fine-tuning necessary for dialing in espresso while maintaining usability for coarser brew methods. This versatility makes the JX-Pro equally capable for espresso grinding and pour-over applications, serving as a genuine all-purpose manual grinder.

At 430 grams and 180mm height, the JX-Pro balances portability with substantial grinding capacity (35-40g). The aluminum body provides durability without excessive weight, making it practical for travel, office use, or home brewing. The grinding speed of 2-3 grams per second means an 18g espresso dose requires approximately 30-40 seconds of grinding—manageable effort for most users without becoming burdensome.

The JX-Pro specifically targets enthusiasts seeking espresso capability in a manual grinder without premium pricing. It competes directly with the Comandante C40 by offering larger burrs, faster grinding, and espresso-focused adjustment at nearly half the price ($159 vs $250-280). This value proposition has made the JX-Pro wildly popular among budget-conscious espresso enthusiasts and travelers who want café-quality grinding in portable format.

1Zpresso's Taiwanese manufacturing provides quality control and precision machining at competitive costs. The company has quickly built reputation for offering excellent performance-per-dollar in manual grinders, challenging established European brands through aggressive pricing and modern design. The JX-Pro exemplifies this approach: professional-grade grinding capability at prosumer prices.

## Basic Information

### Company Background

1Zpresso was founded in Taiwan in 2016, emerging from recognition that the manual coffee grinder market offered opportunity for quality products at more accessible price points than established European manufacturers. The company's founders brought manufacturing expertise from Taiwan's precision engineering industries, applying these capabilities to coffee grinding equipment.

The name "1Zpresso" (pronounced "one-Z-presso") reflects the company's focus: making espresso-quality manual grinding accessible ("one" press away from espresso). While the name might suggest espresso exclusivity, 1Zpresso grinders handle all brewing methods, but espresso capability particularly distinguishes them from budget hand grinders.

Taiwan's manufacturing ecosystem provides 1Zpresso with advantages in precision machining, quality control, and cost efficiency. The company designs grinders in-house and manufactures in Taiwanese facilities, maintaining oversight of production quality while achieving pricing that undercuts European manufacturers significantly.

The JX-Pro specifically emerged from customer feedback about the original JX model. Users praised the JX's build quality and grinding performance but requested finer grinding capability for espresso. The JX-Pro addressed this by extending the adjustment range into espresso territory while maintaining the JX's grinding speed and build quality. The result became 1Zpresso's best-selling model and primary recommendation for espresso enthusiasts.

1Zpresso's product line has expanded to include multiple models targeting different use cases: K-series for espresso focus, JX-series for versatility, Q-series for ultra-portability. This targeted approach allows optimization for specific needs rather than one-size-fits-all design. The JX-Pro occupies the sweet spot: versatile enough for all methods while excelling at espresso.

The company operates primarily through online sales and specialty coffee retailers, avoiding mainstream retail channels. This distribution strategy reduces overhead costs, allowing competitive pricing while maintaining quality. Customer service operates through email support and an active online community where users share tips, troubleshooting, and modifications.

1Zpresso's rapid growth reflects specialty coffee enthusiasts' willingness to try newer brands offering compelling value. While lacking the heritage of Comandante or vintage grinder brands, 1Zpresso has built credibility through consistent quality, responsive customer service, and competitive pricing that makes quality manual grinding accessible to broader audiences.

### Product Development and Design Philosophy

The JX-Pro design prioritizes practical grinding performance over premium aesthetics or heritage branding. This pragmatic approach results in a tool that works exceptionally well without luxury pricing:

**48mm Conical Burrs:**

The burr size represents significant advantage over smaller competitors. Larger burrs offer several theoretical and practical benefits:

**Grinding Speed:** Larger diameter means more cutting surface area, enabling faster grinding. The JX-Pro's 2-3 g/sec grinding rate exceeds the Comandante's ~1-1.5 g/sec, reducing effort and time for equivalent doses.

**Heat Generation:** Larger burrs distribute grinding work over more surface area, reducing heat generation per unit area. This minimizes heat transfer to coffee, preserving aromatics and preventing flavor degradation.

**Particle Distribution:** Larger burrs typically produce more uniform particle size distribution with fewer fines and boulders. The 48mm burrs deliver grind quality competing with much more expensive grinders.

**Longevity:** Larger burrs wear more slowly as work distributes across greater surface area. Expected burr life exceeds 1000kg throughput before replacement consideration.

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

The JX-Pro features external adjustment ring with numbered markings and distinct click detents. Each click represents 12.5-micron adjustment—fine enough for espresso dialing while coarse enough to prevent accidental changes.

The adjustment range spans 200+ clicks from finest to coarsest:
- Clicks 0-25: Espresso range (very fine)
- Clicks 25-40: Moka pot, Aeropress fine
- Clicks 40-60: Aeropress, pour-over medium-fine
- Clicks 60-80: Pour-over medium
- Clicks 80-120: French press, cold brew

The external adjustment (adjustable while grinding) provides convenience over internal adjustment grinders requiring disassembly. The numbered markings enable recording and returning to successful settings—critical for espresso workflow.

**Build Quality:**

Aluminum construction provides excellent strength-to-weight ratio. The machined aluminum body feels substantial without excessive weight (430g—portable but not toy-like). CNC machining creates precise fits between components, minimizing wobble and ensuring smooth operation.

The magnetic catch cup provides secure attachment without threads, enabling quick removal and reattachment. The cup holds 35-40g coffee—adequate for double espresso doses or moderate pour-over amounts.

The handle folds for compact storage and unfolds for grinding leverage. The 140mm handle length provides good mechanical advantage, making grinding easier than shorter handles while maintaining portability.

**Burr Carrier Precision:**

The burr carrier uses multiple bearing surfaces to ensure concentric alignment. This precision prevents wobble that would create inconsistent particle sizes. The carrier tolerances represent significant engineering achievement at this price point—precision typically reserved for grinders costing 2-3x more.

### How It Works

**Basic Operation:**

1. **Adjustment:** Rotate adjustment ring to desired number (lower numbers = finer grind)
2. **Loading:** Remove catch cup, add whole beans to top chamber (35-40g maximum)
3. **Grinding:** Hold body with one hand, rotate handle with other hand
4. **Completion:** Continue grinding until all beans processed (feel and sound change when empty)
5. **Dispensing:** Remove magnetic catch cup, pour ground coffee into brewing device
6. **Cleaning:** Brush out retained grounds periodically

**Grinding Ergonomics:**

The handle rotation requires moderate force—more effort than electric grinding but less than poorly designed hand grinders. The 48mm burrs and efficient bearing system make 18g espresso doses manageable in 30-40 seconds. Coarser grinds require less effort and time.

Body diameter (51mm) fits comfortably in palm, allowing secure grip during grinding. The handle rotation feels smooth without binding or rough spots indicating quality bearing implementation.

**Grind Quality:**

The 48mm burrs produce grind quality exceeding expectations for $159 price point. Espresso shots pull with good extraction and minimal channeling. Pour-over extractions show clarity and balance. The grind distribution competes with grinders costing significantly more.

Retention remains low (0.2-0.5g typical) due to straight-through grinding path and minimal internal chambers where grounds can accumulate. This makes the JX-Pro excellent for single-dosing workflow—weight in approximately equals weight out (minus minimal retention).

## Notes

### Research Notes

The 1Zpresso JX-Pro represents remarkable value in manual grinding, delivering espresso-capable performance with quality build at less than half the price of premium competitors. The 48mm burrs provide genuine advantage in grinding speed and theoretical particle distribution, making the JX-Pro faster and potentially more uniform than smaller-burr alternatives.

The value proposition is compelling for budget-conscious espresso enthusiasts. The $159 price point makes quality manual grinding accessible to users who might balk at $250-300 for Comandante or Kinu. The performance gap is minimal—most users would struggle to blind-taste differences between JX-Pro and Comandante shots.

Build quality exceeds expectations at this price. The aluminum construction feels substantial, machining precision is good, and the adjustment mechanism works smoothly. While aesthetically less refined than premium grinders, the functional quality is excellent.

The espresso capability is genuine, not marketing. Many users report excellent espresso shots rivaling electric grinders costing 2-3x more. The low retention and grind uniformity enable dialing in shots with consistency.

Travel use is primary advantage over electric grinders. The compact size, light weight, and no-electricity operation make the JX-Pro perfect for hotel espresso setups, camping, office use, and traveling with portable espresso machines.

The main trade-off versus Comandante is aesthetics and brand heritage. The JX-Pro is utilitarian—it works exceptionally but doesn't feel precious. For users prioritizing performance over prestige, this is acceptable or even preferred.

### Technical Notes

**Grind Settings Reference:**

**Espresso (varies by machine and bean):**
- Light roasts: 18-25 clicks
- Medium roasts: 15-22 clicks
- Dark roasts: 10-18 clicks

**Fine-tuning:** Each click is 12.5 microns—adjust 1-3 clicks for dialing in

**Pour-Over:**
- [[Hario-V60-Plastic-Dripper]]: 50-60 clicks
- [[Kalita-Wave-185]]: 45-55 clicks
- [[Chemex-Classic-8-Cup]]: 60-70 clicks

**Adjustment Tips:**
- Always adjust finer (clockwise) to eliminate backlash
- If overshooting, go coarser then back to desired setting
- Mark successful settings with tape or notes
- Different beans may need ±5 clicks from baseline

**Maintenance:**
- Brush out grounds after each use
- Deep clean monthly: disassemble, brush burrs, reassemble
- No lubrication needed (dry burrs only)
- Calibrate zero point if adjustment becomes imprecise

**Calibration:**
- Turn adjustment to finest (burrs touching)
- Should feel solid resistance
- If excessive play, contact 1Zpresso support
- Recalibration rarely needed

### Personal Assessment

The 1Zpresso JX-Pro succeeds brilliantly as budget espresso-capable hand grinder. At $159, it delivers grinding performance that competes with grinders costing 2-3x more, making quality manual grinding accessible to enthusiasts who might otherwise compromise with inferior equipment.

The 48mm burrs provide real advantages: faster grinding than Comandante reduces effort for daily doses, while grind quality produces excellent espresso and pour-over results. The low retention enables single-dosing workflow where dose-in equals dose-out.

Build quality is impressive for the price. While not as refined as Comandante's premium materials and finish, the JX-Pro feels substantial and well-made. The aluminum body withstands daily use and travel without issue.

The espresso capability is the JX-Pro's key strength. Many hand grinders claim espresso capability but fail to grind fine enough or uniform enough. The JX-Pro genuinely delivers espresso-quality grinding, enabling excellent shot pulling with proper technique.

For travel and portability, the JX-Pro excels. Compact size, light weight, and no electricity make it perfect for hotel espresso setups, camping, office use. Paired with portable espresso maker (Flair, Picopresso, etc.), enables café-quality espresso anywhere.

The primary weakness is aesthetics. The utilitarian aluminum body lacks the beauty of Comandante's wood and stainless steel. For users wanting a gorgeous tool, Comandante wins. For users prioritizing performance and value, the JX-Pro delivers.

**Personal Rating: 9.0/10**

**Breakdown:**
- Grind Quality: 9/10 (excellent, competitive with premium)
- Build Quality: 8/10 (very good, utilitarian rather than premium)
- Value: 10/10 (exceptional performance for price)
- Espresso Capability: 9/10 (genuine espresso quality)
- Ease of Use: 8/10 (straightforward, slight learning curve)
- Portability: 10/10 (compact, light, durable)
- Speed: 9/10 (fast for hand grinder)
- Overall: 9/10 (exceptional value, recommended)

**Recommendation:** Highly recommended for budget-conscious espresso enthusiasts, travelers, and anyone seeking quality manual grinding without premium pricing. The best value hand grinder available. Choose Comandante only if aesthetics and brand heritage justify 75% premium; otherwise, JX-Pro delivers comparable performance for much less.
