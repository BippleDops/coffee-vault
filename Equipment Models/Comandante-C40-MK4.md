## 📝 Notes

**Research Notes**:

The Comandante C40 is widely regarded as the best hand grinder available. The Nitro Blade burrs (MK4 version) provide exceptional grind consistency with minimal fines, producing excellent results across all brew methods from espresso to French press.

Build quality is outstanding - precision German engineering with quality materials. The grinder feels premium and substantial. Many users report 5+ years of daily use with no performance degradation.

The stepless adjustment system provides infinite grind control, though the click system makes it easy to return to previous settings. Each click is approximately 30-35 microns.

**Technical Notes**:

Grind settings by method (approximate):
- Espresso: 8-12 clicks
- Aeropress: 12-18 clicks
- V60: 20-24 clicks
- Chemex: 24-28 clicks
- French Press: 30-35 clicks
- Cold Brew: 35-40 clicks

The grinder produces minimal static and very low retention (<0.5g), making it efficient and easy to clean. The magnetic catch cup is a nice touch.

**Known Issues**:
- Minor: Handle can work loose (tighten periodically)
- Some users report squeaking (clean and lubricate)
- No grind size indicator (mark preferred settings)
- Manual effort required (40 seconds for 18g dose)

**Recalls**: None

**Firmware Updates**: N/A (mechanical grinder)
