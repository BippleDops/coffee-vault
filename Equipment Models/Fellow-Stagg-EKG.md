## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy

The Stagg EKG represents Fellow's core philosophy: coffee equipment can be beautiful and functional simultaneously. Every detail is considered—the matte powder coat, the gooseneck curve, the counterbalanced handle, the minimalist dial. This isn't just a kettle; it's a design object that happens to make excellent coffee.

The precision gooseneck provides exceptional pour control. The 9mm opening creates a steady, controlled stream perfect for pour-over. The weighted handle provides perfect balance even when full. The slow, controlled pour possible with the Stagg reveals why enthusiasts pay premium prices for gooseneck kettles.

Temperature control is precise and simple. Dial to your target temperature (typically 200-205°F for pour-over), press the button, and the Stagg heats and holds. The hold mode maintains temperature for 60 minutes, eliminating the frustration of re-boiling between cups. For pour-over brewing where temperature matters, this precision is valuable.

### Long-Term Ownership

**5-Year Projection**:
- Expected performance: Excellent (if heating element doesn't fail)
- Common issues: Heating element (some units fail after 2-3 years)
- Aesthetic aging: Powder coat holds up well
- Value: Worth ~$100-120 used
- Satisfaction: Generally very high (design joy daily)

**Total Cost of Ownership** (5 years):
- Purchase: $195
- Electricity: ~$15 (efficient heating)
- Repairs: $0-50 (if heating element replacement needed)
- Total: $210-260 over 5 years = $42-52/year

**Comparison**:
- Bonavita: $75 + $20 (electric) = $95 (5-year TCO)
- Stagg savings: None (you pay for design)
- Stagg value: In design, aesthetics, daily joy of use

## 💭 Personal Assessment

### Overall Impression

The Fellow Stagg EKG is the most beautiful electric kettle on the market. It's also one of the most functional for pour-over brewing. The precision gooseneck provides exceptional pour control. Temperature accuracy is excellent. The hold mode is genuinely convenient. Build quality inspires confidence. Using it is a daily aesthetic pleasure.

However, the $195 price is steep for a kettle. The Bonavita performs 90% as well for $75. The OXO is adequate for $100. You're paying a significant premium for Fellow's design excellence and build quality. Whether that premium is justified depends on how much you value aesthetics and the joy of using beautiful objects.

For pour-over enthusiasts who appreciate design, the Stagg EKG is worth every penny. It makes daily brewing more pleasurable. It elevates your coffee station aesthetically. It provides professional-grade temperature control and pour precision. It's a tool you'll use every day and enjoy using.

For budget-conscious users or those ambivalent about design, the Bonavita or Brewista offers better value. The Stagg's benefits are real but subtle—better pour control, better aesthetics, better build. If these matter to you, the Stagg is worth it. If not, save $120 and get the Bonavita.

### Strengths

**Design Excellence**: Simply the most beautiful electric kettle available. Clean lines, perfect proportions, premium materials. It's a countertop sculpture that makes coffee.

**Pour Control**: The precision gooseneck provides exceptional control. Steady, controlled streams. Perfect for pour-over techniques requiring precision pouring.

**Temperature Precision**: ±1°F accuracy. Dial to exact temperature needed. Hold mode maintains temp for 60 minutes. Professional-grade control in home kettle.

**Build Quality**: 304 stainless steel body, quality powder coat, solid construction. Feels premium, built to last.

**Balanced Ergonomics**: Weighted handle provides perfect balance. Comfortable to hold and pour even when full.

**Ease of Use**: Simple interface. Dial to temp, press button, done. No complex menus or settings (standard EKG).

**Fellow Ecosystem**: Integrates beautifully with other Fellow products. Complete aesthetic coffee station.

### Weaknesses

**Price**: $195 is expensive for electric kettle. Bonavita is $75, OXO is $100. You're paying significant premium for design.

**Capacity**: 0.9L is adequate for most use but smaller than some competitors (Bonavita 1L). May need refill for large batches.

**Heating Element Failures**: Some users report heating element failure after 2-3 years. Not universal but documented concern.

**No °C Option**: Standard EKG is °F only (EKG Pro has °C toggle). International users may prefer Celsius.

**Cord Length**: 1.2m cord may be short for some counter layouts. No easy cord extension option with base design.

**White Finish Aging**: White powder coat can discolor slightly over years (coffee oils, heat exposure). Black finish more forgiving.

### Best Use Cases

**Ideal For**:
- Pour-over enthusiasts (V60, Kalita, Chemex)
- Design-conscious coffee lovers
- Home baristas wanting professional temperature control
- Fellow ecosystem enthusiasts
- Those who value daily aesthetic pleasure
- Premium coffee station builds
- Gift for serious coffee enthusiast

**Not Ideal For**:
- Budget-conscious users ($75 Bonavita better value)
- Large-batch brewing (0.9L may be small)
- General kitchen use (overqualified and expensive)
- Those ambivalent about design (premium not justified)

### Final Recommendation

**Overall Rating**: 9.0/10 (for design-conscious pour-over enthusiasts)

**Highly Recommended For**: Pour-over enthusiasts who appreciate beautiful design and are willing to pay premium for daily aesthetic pleasure combined with excellent functionality.

**Bottom Line**: The Fellow Stagg EKG is the best-designed electric kettle for pour-over coffee. It's beautiful, functional, and a joy to use daily. The $195 price is premium but justified if you value design excellence and professional-grade temperature control. For aesthetics enthusiasts, it's worth every penny. For value-focused users, the Bonavita performs nearly as well for $120 less.

**Would I buy it again?** Yes (design brings daily joy).
**Would I recommend it?** Yes, to design-conscious pour-over enthusiasts with budget.
**Best value?** No (Bonavita better value).
**Best design?** Yes (unquestionably).
**Worth the premium?** If you care about design and aesthetics: absolutely yes. If not: probably no.
