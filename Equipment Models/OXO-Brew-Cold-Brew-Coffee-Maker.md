### Technique Resources

**Standard OXO Cold Brew Recipe** (Concentrate):

**Ratio**: 1:4 coffee to water (by weight)
- Example: 12oz (340g) coffee to 48oz (1,420ml) water
- Note: OXO 32oz capacity means less water than ideal 1:4 ratio
- Adjust: 10oz (280g) coffee to 32oz (946ml) water = ~1:3.4 (stronger concentrate)

**Grind**: Coarse (French press consistency)

**Method**:
1. **Grind coffee**: Coarse grind, 10-12oz (280-340g)
2. **Add coffee to brewing container**: Pour grounds into filter basket
3. **Rainmaker water distribution**:
   - Slowly pour cold filtered water through Rainmaker lid
   - Water disperses evenly over grounds
   - Fill to 32oz line
4. **Stir gently** (optional): Ensure all grounds saturated
5. **Refrigerate**: Place assembled unit in refrigerator
6. **Steep**: 12-24 hours (16-18 hours typical)
   - 12 hours: Milder, sweeter
   - 16-18 hours: Balanced (recommended)
   - 24 hours: Strong, more extraction
7. **Release**: Pull silicone stopper, cold brew drips into carafe
8. **Wait**: Allow complete drainage (10-15 minutes)
9. **Store**: Remove brewing container, attach airtight lid
10. **Dilute**: Mix 1:1 with water or milk (or to taste)
11. **Serve**: Over ice, enjoy

**Recipe Variations**:

**Ready-to-Drink Cold Brew** (Less concentrated):
- Ratio: 1:8 coffee to water
- 6oz (170g) coffee to 32oz (946ml) water
- Steep: 12-16 hours
- Serve: Straight, over ice (no dilution needed)

**Extra-Strong Concentrate**:
- Ratio: 1:3 coffee to water
- 12oz (340g) coffee to 32oz (946ml) water (max capacity)
- Steep: 18-24 hours
- Dilute: 1:2 or 1:3 with water/milk

**Flavored Cold Brew**:
- Add to grounds before steeping:
  - Vanilla bean (split, seeds scraped)
  - Cinnamon stick
  - Cardamom pods
  - Cocoa nibs
  - Orange peel
- Steep as normal, flavors infuse

**New Orleans Style** (Chicory):
- Mix 20% chicory with coffee grounds
- Steep as normal
- Serve with milk and sugar

**Troubleshooting Recipes**:
- **Too weak**: More coffee, longer steep, or less dilution
- **Too strong/bitter**: Less coffee, shorter steep, or more dilution
- **Sour notes**: Steep longer (under-extracted)
- **Bitter/astringent**: Steep less (over-extracted), use medium roast

- Consistent: Same process yields same results
- Clean: Fine filter removes sediment (clear, clean cold brew)
- Convenient: Minimal cleanup, dishwasher safe

### Cold Brew Science

**Why Cold Brew Tastes Different**:
- **Temperature**: Cold water extracts differently than hot
- **Time**: 12-24 hours vs. 3-5 minutes (slow extraction)
- **Acidity**: Cold water extracts less acidic compounds (smoother, lower acidity)
- **Bitterness**: Less bitter than hot brew (certain bitter compounds need heat)
- **Sweetness**: Sweetness preserved (acids don't dominate)
- **Body**: Full-bodied, smooth (oils extracted but not broken down by heat)
- **Flavor profile**: Chocolate, nut, caramel (muted brightness, emphasized body)

**Ideal Beans for Cold Brew**:
- **Medium roasts**: Balanced, sweet, smooth (best for cold brew)
- **Medium-dark**: Chocolatey, rich, low acidity (excellent)
- **Dark roasts**: Bold, smooth, but can be one-dimensional
- **Light roasts**: Underwhelming (brightness muted, origin characteristics lost)
- **Origins**: South American, Indonesian (chocolate, nut, low acidity)

**Ratio Science**:
- **Concentrate (1:4)**: Strong, dilute before drinking
- **Ready-to-drink (1:8)**: Drink straight, balanced strength
- **OXO challenge**: 32oz capacity limits ideal ratio (compromise needed)
- **Dilution**: Concentrate allows flexibility (dilute to preference)

**Steep Time Impact**:
- **8-10 hours**: Under-extracted (sour, weak, tea-like)
- **12-14 hours**: Mild, sweet, balanced (good for light preferences)
- **16-18 hours**: Ideal (balanced extraction, smooth, rich)
- **20-24 hours**: Strong, full extraction (chocolatey, bold)
- **24+ hours**: Over-extracted (can become astringent or woody)

**Grind Size Importance**:
- **Too fine**: Over-extraction, bitterness, filter clogs
- **Too coarse**: Under-extraction, weak, sour
- **Ideal**: Coarse (like French press, sea salt consistency)
- **OXO filter**: Fine mesh handles wide grind range

### Practical Use Insights

- **Planning**: Need to start batch 12-24 hours before need
- **Fridge space**: Occupies refrigerator real estate during steeping
- **Not instant**: Can't decide to make cold brew and drink it now

### Sustainability & Environmental Impact

**Advantages**:
- **Reusable filter**: No paper filters (zero ongoing waste)
- **Durable construction**: 5-10 year lifespan (long-term use)
- **No electricity**: Cold water steeping (zero energy)
- **Glass carafe**: Reusable, recyclable at end of life
- **Minimal waste**: Coffee grounds compostable

**Considerations**:
- **Plastic components**: Tritan and other plastics (petroleum-based)
- **Glass production**: Energy-intensive (but one-time)
- **Replacement parts**: Available (extends life, reduces waste)
- **Shipping**: Imported from China (carbon footprint)

**Overall**: Very sustainable due to reusability, no consumables, and no energy use

**Compared to Café Cold Brew**:
- Café: Disposable cups, lids, straws (significant waste)
- OXO: Reusable everything (minimal waste)
- Environmental win: Home cold brew vastly more sustainable

### Best Practices Summary

**For Best Cold Brew**:
1. Use quality, fresh coffee (roasted within 1 month)
2. Coarse grind (French press consistency)
3. Filtered water (good water = good coffee)
4. Rainmaker slow pour (even saturation)
5. 16-18 hour steep (balanced extraction)
6. Refrigerate during steeping (prevents spoilage, maintains freshness)
7. Dilute to taste (1:1 is starting point, adjust preference)

**For Consistent Results**:
1. Measure coffee and water by weight (scale, not volume)
2. Same coffee-to-water ratio (1:4 or 1:3.4 for OXO capacity)
3. Same steep time (set timer, be consistent)
4. Same grind size (consistent grinder setting)
5. Record what works (note ratio, time, beans for repeatability)

**For Longevity**:
1. Clean filter regularly (prevents clogging)
2. Handle glass carafe carefully (main vulnerability)
3. Replace silicone stopper when worn (every 2-3 years)
4. Don't thermal shock glass (avoid extreme temperature changes)
5. Store dry when not in use (prevents odors and mold)
6. Dishwasher top rack only (extends component life)
